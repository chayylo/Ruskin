                    she would have been stretched between her regular housekeeping duties and nursing <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>, so it makes sense 
                    that a girl would have been hired to help in the house. The fifteen&#x2010;year&#x2010;old <span class="persName-ASB">Anne</span> presumably was inexperienced, 
                    not yet the servant who, according to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s testimonial, &#x201C;was never quite in her glory unless some of us were ill&#x201D;

But a mere girl&#x02BC;s service may have been as much as the Ruskins could afford in their straitened circumstances. 
                    To reduce expenses, <span class="persName-CR">Catherine</span> had pressed her husband to move from <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span> to the country,

                    she was to some extent privy to the most dramatic events of her employers&#x02BC; lives. <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> and <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> had been betrothed since <span class="date-1809">1809</span>, 
                    and the crisis of <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s near&#x2010;lethal illness appears to have deepened their commitment, but now their union faced opposition by <span class="persName-JTR">John Thomas</span>. 
                    <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> was convinced that the tension would bring about <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s death (see <span class="title-letter-mr_to_jjr_1814-07-12">Margaret Cock to John James Ruskin, 12 July 1814</span>;

                    Unexpectedly, in <span class="date-1815-06">June 1815</span>, <span class="persName-JTR">John Thomas</span> descended into madness. His son&#x02BC;s emotions were divided between apprehension for his parents and relief for himself and <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>. 
                    Writing to his mother, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> rejected recourse to a &#x201C;public asylum&#x201D; where his father would be subjected to &#x201C;Surrounding Horrors&#x201D;, 
                    while recognizing that even &#x201C;the strictest confinement&#x201D; at home risked the &#x201C;safety&#x201D; and &#x201C;health of the rest of the family&#x201D;. Writing to <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>, 
                    he expressed compassion for his father&#x02BC;s &#x201C;frailties&#x201D; but he could not resist interpreting his father&#x02BC;s madness to their advantage 
                    as having rendered his father &#x201C;in a manner dead to all of us&#x201D;, exonerating the family from &#x201C;a place in his affections&#x201D;, and putting their

                    As it turned out, release came by way of further calamity: in <span class="date-1817-10">October 1817</span>, <span class="persName-CR">Catherine Ruskin</span> died suddenly,

         <div class="p">As a young servant at <span class="placeName-building-BOWERSWELL">Bowerswell</span>, <span class="persName-ASB">Anne</span> shared the women&#x02BC;s vantage on these events, which helps to explain a degree of intimacy
