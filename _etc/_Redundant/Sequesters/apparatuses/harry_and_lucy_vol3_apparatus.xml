                        complete many projects for <date when="1829-01-01">New Year&#x02BC;s 1828/29</date>, including a <title type="drama" corresp="#PUNCHANDJUDY">Punch

                        has only &#x201C;4 days&#x201D; to finish his poem &#x201C;A Battle&#x201D; before &#x201C;entering
                        upon another year&#x201D; (i.e., <date notBefore="1828-12-28" notAfter="1828-12-31">December 28&#x2013;31</date>, or possibly <date notBefore="1828-12-29" notAfter="1829-01-01">December
                        29&#x2013;January 1</date>). The poem was completed in time, despite the
                        particularly elaborate fair&#x2010;copying in a special &#x201C;double print&#x201D;
                        lettering (see no. 33). This style of lettering was used also for
                        the capital letters and arabic numerals in the first three pages
                        of <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title> (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIIIA">MS IIIA</title>). From page four, the fancy
                        lettering was abandoned, presumably because time was growing
                        short before New Year&#x02BC;s, and, in the end, the project was left
                        unfinished altogether, both in draft and fair copy.
                        Sources and Background.&#x2014;Although the beginning of the
                        narrative is connected perfunctorily with the <date when="1827">1827</date> homeward trip
                        from <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> at end of no. 20, the main business of this last
                        volume of <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title> is to describe <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">&#x201C;Harry&#x02BC;s&#x201D;</persName> activities at
                        home during <date notBefore="1828-09-22" notAfter="1828-12-21">autumn 1828</date>. While the first volume of <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and
                        Lucy&#x201D;</title> was the most derivative of Edgeworthian scientific projects
                        and the second volume devoted mainly to travel, this third volume
                        is the most domestic, with <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">&#x201C;Harry&#x201D;</persName> rehearsing his daily
                        activities at <placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName>. The role of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">&#x201C;Lucy&#x201D;</persName> has probably been
                        assumed by <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s cousin from <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>, who had
                        
                        arrived in the household by mid&#x2010;July, orphaned by her mother&#x02BC;s
                        death (TLC, 7).
                        The narrative and its presentation are as obsessive as
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s New Year&#x02BC;s poem with its double lettering. This <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry
                        and Lucy,&#x201D;</title> unlike the two earlier volumes, is unenlivened by
                        &#x201C;plates,&#x201D; although the narrative does mention drawing a good
                        deal. Instead of plates, the volume is burdened with lists,
                        including such pedantry as a list of &#x201C;errata&#x201D; consisting of only
                        one erratum&#x2014;and that single erratum is not really erroneous.
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> has ruled the paper, not only vertically for justifying
                        the margins, but also horizontally for regulating the ascenders
                        and descenders of his letters. In previous <title type="manuscript" corresp="JRREDBOOK">Red Books</title>, the
                        lettering sizes had varied widely.
                        The story opens with <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> punctiliously scheduling times
                        for his &#x201C;various employments,&#x201D; which now include instructing <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName>
                        in the constellations before breakfast. If <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> really did
                        subject his cousin <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> to this numbing exercise, his priggish
                        behavior may have been aimed at establishing dominance over the
                        newcomer to the household. The attitude may have been reserved
                        for female cousins, since male cousins, such as <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName> and
                        <persName corresp="#CTR">Charles</persName>, were regarded with reverence (see, e.g., no. 6).
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have owed his priggishness to <persName corresp="#MRC">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s
                        response to having to cope suddenly two children. While <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MAMMA">Mamma</persName> in
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s stories is always presented as the voice of order, in
                        the first volume she does not check <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName>&#x02BC;s energy, and
                        even rewards them for telling the truth when they cause mischief
                        
                        (no. 3, chap. 3). By contrast, in the third volume, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> seems
                        preoccupied with reporting that &#x201C;he was to do&#x201D; this and &#x201C;had also
                        to&#x201D; do that. While <persName type="fictional" corresp="#JARRY">Harry</persName> remains as active as ever, so much so
                        that he cannot finish his projects, there is a sense of screwing
                        down the hatches, a guarding against threats of disorder to &#x201C;our
                        peaceful home&#x201D; as in the poem <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEDEFIANCEOFWAR">&#x201C;Defiance of War&#x201D;</title> (no. 7), which
                        was written following cousin <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>&#x02BC;s departure and death.
                        In an unpublished passage of <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA">Praeterita</title> summarizing his
                        cousin&#x02BC;s part in the &#x201C;ideal child&#x2010;life&#x201D; at <placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>
                        combines condescension toward <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> with guilt over how she was
                        treated.
                        <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName>&#x02BC;s entrance into its selfish narrowness which had she
                        been either of less submissive nature, or of brighter
                        intelligence, might have infused a healthier leaven into
                        it, brought, instead, an extremely subtle element of evil
                        in the difference of feeling with which my parents regarded
                        her and me. They would have been greatly wiser in placing
                        her at a good school: the girl would have been less
                        indulged, indeed; but also, less mortified.&#x2014;as it was, her
                        life passed between moments of checked affection and
                        repressed indignation; my mother and she were really fond
                        of each other, and in the main tenor of it, her life was
                        happy,&#x2014;yet she continually felt herself degraded by
                        grudged gifts, and neglected, though the object of
                        reluctant care. My parents thought they did a generous duty
                        by her in taking her with us always, on our continental
                        
                        journeys. But Mary had little curiosity and no enthusiasm,
                        and would have been really happier in the natural and
                        unvexed life she might have led in a Scottish village, than
                        in being taken to see palaces and cathedrals on the outside
                        seat. Her companionship with me, though never felt by me as
                        an annoyance, was entirely spiritless and colourless: we
                        neither helped, teazed, nor much pleased each other. On the
                        whole, I liked better to have Mary with me in a walk than
                        not,&#x2014;yet our talk was commonplace, and I should have seen
                        more, and thought to better purpose, had I been with old
                        Anne.
                        Viljoen objects that &#x201C;the outside seat&#x201D; was a sensible place for
                        Mary in a single family carriage, and that, later, when the
                        family drove two char&#x2010;a&#x2010;bancs, Ruskin sat with Anne and the
                        courier in one, while Mary traveled with the elders. Viljoen is
                        probably right to object, too, to the judgment on Mary&#x02BC;s
                        curiosity: her travel diaries, while not brilliant, are more than
                        merely dutiful. More difficult to assess is Ruskin&#x02BC;s belief about
                        Mary&#x02BC;s resentments. Ruskin himself can easily be substituted in
                        the role of &#x201C;checked affection and repressed indignation,&#x201D; and
                        the passage may well involve projection, as well as some
                        The increased rigidity should viewed in context of the
                        family&#x02BC;s experiences with cousins living at Herne Hill and not
                        attributed to Mary Richardson in particular. She has been
                        suspected of making a nuisance of herself during an earlier stay
                        at Herne Hill, since a May 1827 letter from Ruskin to his father
                        
                        indicates resentment over disruptions caused by her visit: &#x201C;I
                        have changed very much in my lessons for while mary was with me I
                        said them very ill every day but now I almost say them very well
                        every day&#x201D; (RFL 157). Burd identifies this &#x201C;Mary&#x201D; as Mary
                        Richardson of Perth (RFL, 159 n. 2), but the girl is almost
                        certainly Mary Bridget Richardson of Croydon, Margaret&#x02BC;s niece by
                        her sister Bridget.
                        It was the Croydon Mary, not her Scottish cousin, who
                        became a family byword for awkwardness and disruption. As Burd
                        himself notes, Mary Bridget was denied a place in the Herne Hill
                        household that Margaret&#x02BC;s relations had sought for her, because
                        John James always looked askance at vulgar Croydon, and Margaret
                        acquiesced to the snobbery: &#x201C;[my sister] Bridget,&#x201D; Margaret wrote
                        to her husband, &#x201C;feels much mortification that [her daughter]
                        Mary is not to have her home with us and has suffered greatly but
                        Mr. R[ichardson of Croydon, her husband] &#x0026; her brothers are
                        perfectly satisfied&#x201D; (RFL 162). Confusion of the two Marys arises
                        from Margaret&#x02BC;s segue, earlier in this letter, from praising John
                        James for saving &#x201C;your sister [i.e., Jessie of Perth] from
                        pecuniary suffering&#x201D; to praising him for &#x201C;the arrangements you
                        have made for Mary&#x201D; and thereby &#x201C;reliev[ing] me from a weight of
                        anxiety&#x201D; (emphasis added, 162). The two acts of charity are
                        unrelated, the latter referring to the Croydon relations, as
                        confirmed by Margaret&#x02BC;s comment, undoubtedly referring to her
                        own, poorer relations, that Bridget &#x201C;says she cannot bear you  
                        should be at such expence but still she seems hurt that I should
                        feel her child such a burden&#x201D; (162&#x2013;63).
                        The charitable &#x201C;arrangements&#x201D; for the Croydon Mary must
                        refer to her schooling by a Miss Williamson, to whom John James
                        made payments at this time. This again is a source of confusion,
                        Burd assuming that the schooling was for Mary of Perth (RFL 157
                        n. 2, 164 n. 3); however, while the Perth cousin is known to have
                        attended this school in 1830&#x2013;31, that fact proves only that the
                        Ruskins chose the same girls&#x02BC; academy for the Perth Mary that
                        they had already patronized for the Croydon Mary. The Scottish
                        cousin appears to have performed well at school&#x2014;she grew
                        accomplished at drawing before Ruskin did, for example&#x2014;while
                        Mary Bridget retained the reputation of a bumpkin, at least
                        according to the always questionable Praeterita. An unpublished
                        passage of the autobiography is quoted and annotated by Viljoen:
                        In grown&#x2010;up girlhood, [Mary Bridget] was always more or
                        less a thorn in my mother&#x02BC;s side; more might perhaps have
                        been done for her, if we had cared more. At last [on 13
                        April 1835] she married a Mr. Fox [namely, Isaac Fox, a
                        sailor], of whom I saw little and remember nothing, of rank
                        somewhat above a tradesman&#x2014;just enough to be
                        uncomfortable. They went out to Sydney, where Bridget&#x02BC;s
                        elder brother was already prospering, and in a year or two
                        [1845] she died, I believe in childbirth. (HGVP, box D.V,
                        chap. 4, p. 32; ....)
                        
                        If Mary Richardson of Perth did not bear the stigma of
                        Croydon vulgarity, her first months at Herne Hill could still
                        have caused the rigidity evident in &#x201C;Harry and Lucy.&#x201D; The Ruskins
                        probably would not have considered adopting the Perth Mary,
                        before being forced into the position by her mother&#x02BC;s death in
                        1828. They had grown shy of taking on Jesse&#x02BC;s children, when her
                        son James, who had lived at Herne Hill, fell ill of tuberculosis
                        and had to be removed to Perth, where he died in May 1826. At
                        that time, Margaret resolved against further adoptions: &#x201C;all we
                        now have to do is to make the comfort and welfare of those
                        remaining our study and do all in our power except taking them as
                        inmates and bringing ourselves under such responsibility as we
                        did for James&#x201D; (RFL 44). That the ban was upheld against her own
                        sister&#x02BC;s daughter but not against Mary of Perth probably reflects
                        John James&#x02BC;s attitudes&#x2014;his partiality toward his own sister&#x02BC;s
                        family, and his reservations about the Croydon cousins&#x02BC; social
                        suitability (see RSH 89).
                        As it turned out, despite Harry&#x02BC;s strict timetable, Ruskin
                        failed to complete his puppet theater in time for New Year&#x02BC;s (see
                        no. 35; see also his New Year&#x02BC;s Eve apology in RFL, 170&#x2013;71
                        [facsimile in Works, vol. 2, facing p. 264]). Judging by the
                        differences between the plan described in the MS II draft and the
                        specifications in the fair copy, Ruskin may not have been able to
                        construct the theater successfully. The &#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;
                        narrative itself was likewise left incomplete, in both draft and
                        fair copy&#x2014;the fair copy in MS IIIA even breaking off in the
                        
                        middle of a sentence. Probably owing to these unrealized
                        ambitions, in 1829 Margaret began showing irritation with the
                        impropriety of &#x201C;beginning too eagerly and becoming careless
                        towards the end of his works as he calls them&#x201D; (RFL 187; see nos.
                        35, 47).
                        At the end of the MS II draft (a portion not fair&#x2010;copied in
                        MS IIIA), Harry decides to save the puppet theater for his
                        father&#x02BC;s birthday. Whether Ruskin constructed the theater is
                        unknown, but certainly one result of his plans was to begin &#x201C;The
                        Puppet Show&#x201D; (no. 35), the charming watercolor vignettes of
                        &#x201C;puppets&#x201D; with accompanying verses. The manuscript presentation
                        for John James&#x02BC;s 1829 birthday proved to be a handmade pamphlet
                        containing nos. 29, 36, 41, 44, and 57 (see no. 57). No. 57 is a
                        verse play about Waterloo, and Ruskin might well have performed
                        his drama with homemade puppets.
                        In the narrative, &#x201C;Harry&#x201D; is now studying Virgil&#x02BC;s &#x201C;4 th
                        pastoral&#x201D; (the &#x201C;Messianic&#x201D; eclogue). Since Ruskin was studying
                        basic Latin by early 1827 (no. 10) and the Aeneid during the
                        first half of 1829 (MS II, letter to Mrs. Monro), he might well
                        have been studying the Eclogues during the last half of 1828. He
                        also discusses his skill in mapmaking&#x2014;here, a map of England and
                        Wales, although RFL (173, 178) mentions only a map of Switzerland
                        during this period.
