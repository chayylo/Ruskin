                    <p>In &#x201C;<title type="essay" corresp="#HANSONRUSKIN1830S">Ruskin in the 1830s</title>&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#DCH">Hanson</persName> argues that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> wrongly assumed that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would have composed a topographical poem only about a place he had actually seen, 
                        and that therefore <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> must have received his commission for &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">Saltzburg</title>&#x201D; from <persName corresp="#TP">Thomas Pringle</persName>, the editor of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</title>, while visiting <placeName corresp="#SALZBURG">Salzburg<placeName> during the family tour of <date when="1835">1835</date>. 
                        Not only would this alleged timing of the commission have been impossible for a text that must have been submitted for publication one year earlier; 
                        the underlying assumption is faulty, as well, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> being fully immersed in the print culture of illustrated travel writing. The commission, and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem itself, 
                        should not be understood in context of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s aesthetics of &#x201C;truth to nature&#x201D; a decade later, but of his practical introduction to ekphrastic writing for the annuals. 
                        Like many other contributors to the annuals, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was commissioned to respond creatively to an engraving of a foreign scene, not to the experience of the place itself.</p>
                    <p>It can be added to this argument that, in assigning this commission to the young writer, <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> replicated an assignment he had given to himself as editor of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1830">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering for <date when="1830">1830</date></title>. 
                        That volume also featured an engraving after <persName corresp="#WPPAINTER">William Purser</persName>, the artist of <title type="artwork" corresp="#PURSERSALTZBURG"><hi rend="italic">Saltzburg</hi></title>. 
                        Entitled <title type="artwork" corresp="#PURSERSPOLETO"><hi rend="italic">Spoleto</hi></title> and engraved by <persName corresp="#TJEAVONS">Thomas Jeavons</persName> (<date notBefore="1795" notAfter="1867">1795&#x2013;1867</date>), 
                        the plate appears to have been the first appearance of <persName corresp="#WPPAINTER">Purser</persName>&#x02BC;s work in the annual, and <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> gave himself the task of writing the accompanying text. 
                        (<persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> himself never visited the Continent, much less <placeName corresp="#SPOLETO">Spoleto</placeName>, which was not well known to English travelers. 
                        In the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, <persName corresp="#MSA">Mariana Starke</persName> devoted only a brief paragraph to the town in describing the route from <placeName corresp="#ROME">Rome</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#FLORENCE">Florence</placeName>. 
                        In the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>, <persName corresp="#WBI">William Brockedon</persName> drew attention to the town&#x02BC;s picturesque approach and surrounding countryside. <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#STARKETRAVELSINEUROPE1828">See <persName corresp="#MSA">Starke</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#STARKETRAVELSINEUROPE1828"><hi rend="italic">Travels in Europe</hi></title> [<date when="1828">1828</date>]</ref>, 411;

                        Even <persName corresp="#WPPAINTER">Purser</persName> probably lacked first&#x2010;hand experience of the scene, having based his drawing on &#x201C;a sketch by <persName corresp="#RMG">Captain [Robert] Melville Grindlay</persName>&#x201D;, 
                        who had connections with <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>.  <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="grindlay_r_m_note.php">See Chatterjee, <persName corresp="#RMG">Robert Melville</persName></ref>;

                    </p>
                    <p>In the plate, <persName corresp="#WPPAINTER">Purser</persName> renders the scene on a plan similar to the composition of <hi rend="italic">Saltzburg</hi>. <placeName corresp="#SPOLETO">Spoleto</placeName> is viewed from a distant, central vantage 
                        in the countryside above the town, its major monuments picked out in the middle ground. In the foreground, figures in local costume orient the spectator&#x02BC;s gaze into the prospect. 
                        <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s accompanying text makes no pretence of being a traveler other than from his armchair. As a preface to a poem, &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#PRINGLESPOLETO">Spoleto</title>&#x201D;, 
                        he fills the space adjacent to the engraving with a prose extract from a travel account, 
                        <title type="book" corresp="#EUSTACECLASSICALTOUR">A Classical Tour through Italy</title> (<date when="1813">1813</date>) by <persName corresp="JCEUSTACE">Rev. John Chetwode Eustace</persName> (<date notBefore="1761" notAfter="1815">1761&#x2013;1815</date>), which summarizes the triumph of ancient <placeName corresp="#SPOLETO">Spoleto</placeName> over <persName corresp="#HANNIBAL">Hannibal</persName>&#x02BC;s invading army, 
                        and highlights major monuments of the town today.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> swerves from this dry annotation, however, to introduce what &#x201C;will probably be esteemed by most readers [as] more interesting than pages of further details from more ordinary tourists&#x201D;&#x2014;some 
                        observations on <placeName corresp="#SPOLETO">Spoleto</placeName> from an unpublished travel journal lent by <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="rogers_samuel_note.php"><persName corresp="#SR">Samuel Rogers</persName></ref>.<!-- bio note --> 
                        Although much briefer and less informative than the extract from <persName corresp="#JCEUSTACE">Eustace</persName>&#x02BC;s published account, 
                        <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s jottings are in keeping with the governing sentiments of the literary annuals&#x2014;friendship and memory.

                        which turn out to be a curtailed and revised version of a passage that would later appear in <title type="book" corresp="#ROGERSJOURNAL">The Italian Journal of Samuel Rogers</title>:</p>

                    <p><persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> abridges the passage in order to feature the final and more poetic closing sentence&#x2014;a poetic evocation of the scene by moonlight, with a meditation on history. 
                        In the poem following these prose extracts, then, the reader is to understand the speaker as meditating on the scene depicted in the plate, 
                        but in the light of expressive memories that have been shared with him by <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>. From one &#x201C;Whom &#x02BC;tis a pride and grace to call my Friend&#x201D;&#x2014;the concluding line of the poem&#x2014;the 
                        quotation lends romance to the vedute and prosy history, which would otherwise fail to be integrated as a friendship&#x02BC;s offering.</p>
                    <p>One can speculate that, four years later, when <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> had another plate by <persName corresp="#WPPAINTER">Purser</persName>, <title type="artwork" corresp="#PURSERSALTZBURG">Saltzburg</title>, to assign to a writer for the upcoming volume for <date when="1835">1835</date>, 
                        he chose <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in spite of the youth&#x02BC;s lack of professional experience, 
                        in part because the editor was impressed by the youth&#x02BC;s ability to match words with pictures, but also because behind the scene he could dedicate the assignment as an act of friendship. 
                        Since it was at about this time that <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> arranged for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to be introduced to <persName corresp="#SR">Samuel Rogers</persName>, 
                        and escorted him to <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <placeName corresp="#STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</placeName> residence 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HANSONRUSKIN1830S"><persName corresp="#DCH">Hanson</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HANSONRUSKIN1830S"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin in the 1830s</hi></title> 000</ref>; <persName corresp="#SR">Samuel Rogers</persName>), 
                        it is more probable that <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> would have invested the &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">Saltzburg</title>&#x201D; commission with greater significance than the mere happenstance that <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> supposes&#x2014;that 
                        &#x201C;[i]t happened that <persName corresp="#TP">Mr. Pringle</persName> had a plate of <placeName corresp="#SALZBURG">Salzburg</placeName> which he wanted to print in order to make up the volume of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</title> for the next Christmas&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WGCLIFEOFJR1893"><title type="book" corresp="#WGCLIFEOFJR1893">Life and Work of John Ruskin</title>,</ref> 1:52). Rather, in conferring such an impressive commission on a fifteen&#x2010;year&#x2010;old first&#x2010;time contributor, 
                        <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> would have shown his regard for the Ruskin family, and formalized his role of mentor and friend to the young poet, just as <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> had condescended to <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>. 
                        A tribute to an elder and greater poet occupies the entirety of <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s conclusion of his poem on <placeName corresp="#SPOLETO">Spoleto</placeName>, framing the ekphrasis 
                        as an offering to a lasting poet from the pages of an ephemeral publication, &#x201C;Framed for the passing purpose of a day&#x201D; in the calendar of an annual, by a &#x201C;rustic&#x201D; Scots poet:</p>

                    <p>Lines from <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#PRINGLESPOLETO">Spoleto</title>&#x201D; are possibly echoed by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">Saltzburg</title>&#x201D;.</p>
                    <p>The extract first highlights the town&#x02BC;s fame for repulsing an attack by <persName corresp="#HANNIBAL">Hannibal</persName>&#x02BC;s army, following the Cathaginian victory over <placeName corresp="#ROME">Rome</placeName>, a continuing source of local pride which is mentioned in all guidebooks. 
                        The passage then scans the town&#x02BC;s major monuments, using a strategy that may have been instructive to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>. As a Roman Catholic priest,

                        and the prospect looking outward from its terrace. This accidental juxtaposition of conflicting viewpoints may have given; the &#x201C;barbarous antiquity&#x201D; of its castle
