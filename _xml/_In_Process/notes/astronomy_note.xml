                <p>Between <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1828">1826 and 1828</date>, astronomy featured persistently in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poetry and prose, 
                    from his first mention of the typical beginner&#x02BC;s constellation for British children, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name>, 
                    in the <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1827">1826/27</date> poem,

                    to his cataloguing of constellation names from all around the celestial globe in the <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1828">1827/28</date> poem,

                    to his assigning the task of memorizing constellation names and their respective numbers of stars to his character <persName corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName> in the dialogue, 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III&#x201D;</title></ref>;
                    to his Miltonic hymn of praise in the New Year&#x02BC;s poem for <date when="1828-01-01">January 1828</date>, 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="the_sun_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHESUN">&#x201C;The Sun&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> composed these works in context of rising popular education in astronomy for adults and children 
                    in the <date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1839">first three decades of the nineteenth century</date> in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>. 
                    On this evidence, he was engaged more by the poetic sublimity of the subject than by the science, although these works contain hints that he gained at least basic conceptual 
                    understanding of the solar system and the fixed stars.</p>

                            and there follow lists of constellation names paired with their respective numbers of stars. The identity of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;lesson book&#x201D; has eluded detection 
                            since <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName>&#x02BC;s totals of stars have so far failed to match the statistics supplied in British astronomy texts commonly available in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>. 
                            These counts of observable stars within the constellation boundaries changed over time, and the constellations themselves 
                            changed as new ones were added and others consigned to obsolescence, so <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s source may yet be found. 
                            Or he may have devised his own method of counting stars, such as numbering only stars of a certain magnitude. 
                            Whatever the case, the kind of book normally associated with this exacting information was a <hi rend="italic">star atlas</hi>.</p>

                            the British public with a star atlas that boasted a dedication to the king, <persName corresp="KG4">George IV</persName>, and that could compete credibly with the French and German atlases then in common use.

                            any star atlas would have posed a daunting text for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> at ages seven to nine. In <date when="1835">1835</date>,

                                which &#x201C;is the cause why the sun and stars seem to rise and set&#x201D;. The dialogue ends by asking 
                                &#x201C;why the earth does not fall into the sun&#x201D;. Apropos, this dialogue is preceded by a ballad,

                                which, after describing centrifugal and centripetal forces using illustrations drawn everyday experiences, 
                                praises &#x201C;the wonderful skill of the <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#CREATOR">Creator</persName> [whereby] these two forces were made

                                delays this topic in favor of lesson in using a globe to understand the world&#x02BC;s differences in climate and the influence on vegetation, animals, and human cultures. 
                                An explanation of the planets&#x02BC; orbits is deferred to another day when he will &#x201C;take you to the lecture of an ingenious philosopher

                                Basic as it is, this seven&#x2010;starred constellation is not officially recognized in the star atlases, being subsumed within <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major (the Great Bear)</name>; 
                                as <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName> acknowledges, it is &#x201C;the country people&#x201D; who know <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major</name> &#x201C;by the title of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name>: in some places it is called the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#PLOUGH">Plough</name>, 
                                an agricultural machine, which it certainly resembles&#x201D; (Celestial Atlas, 24). Nonetheless, despite not its &#x201C;proper name&#x201D;, the vulgar name of the constellation is used 
                                by the educational dialogues because the introductory lesson associated with it is a practical one.</p>
                            
                            <p>As <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TUTORJJ">tutor</persName> explains, <name type="astronomcial" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name> serves as a compass for finding one&#x02BC;s bearings at night, 
                                when the sun&#x02BC;s position is unavailable to define east and west. As a northern, circumpolar constellation, 
                                <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major</name> or <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC; Wain</name> is always visible on a clear night; 
                                and as the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TUTORJJ">Tutor</persName>&#x02BC;s diagram shows, the constellation points to the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#POLARIS">Polaris (the North Star)</name> 
                                if one traces a line upward through the two stars forming the rear end of the wagon. From this first point of reference, 
                                the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TUTORJJ">Tutor</persName> proceeds to instruct

As 
                            remarked previously, the random order in which he names constellations in his poem suggests that he failed to master even the most basic astronomical concepts,  
                            as presented in <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName>&#x02BC;s elementary primer. Nonetheless, the atlas would have appealed not only in its visual depictions and prose summaries of myths; 
                            it would also have bolstered <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s pride in British achievements in astronomical discovery and science. A consistent theme in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem is his observance of constellations with British associations, such as

                        <p><persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName> advises: &#x201C;A teacher, when hearing the class, should use globes, or plates,

                            Plates and globes depicted the mythical figures for which the constellations were named; and plates were found in star atlases, 
                            which among other information related the stories associated with the stars and constellations, 
                            such as the myth of the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MILKYWAY">Milky Way (Via Lactea)</name> that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> uses to frame his conclusion to the second fair copy (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>): 
                            &#x201C;the ancients thought&#x201D; it &#x201C;the road / Which all their best and bravest trod / Unto great <persName type="fictional" corresp="#JUPITERGOD">Jupiters</persName> blest abode&#x201D;.</p>
