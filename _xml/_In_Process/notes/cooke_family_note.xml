                <p>Family of English engravers and artists. Of German ancestry, the brothers William Bernard (1779-1855) and George (1781-1834), 
                    were apprenticed to engravers in the late eighteenth century, when English engraving was undergoing stylistic and technical development 
                    along with British landscape painting and illustration. William Bernard was also an entrepreneur 
                    who operated a print shop and gallery in Soho Square, London (ca. 1821-30). The gallery exhibited English engraving and watercolor, 
                    some exhibitions showing items on loan from collectors. George, with the assistance of the brothers' studio, 
                    was extensively occupied by an aquatint project in botanical illustration, The Botanical Cabinet (1817-33). 
                    A son of George became the marine painter, Edward William Cooke (1811-80). 
                    A cousin of Edward, William John Cooke, was an engraver, who contributed advancements in etching steel 
                    (Munday, Edward William Cooke, 27, 32-33, 37-38).</p>
                <p>The elder brothers oversaw several other projects in their shop (Munday, Edward William Cooke, 34, 39-42), 
                    but their most important joint project was Picturesque Views of the Southern Coast of England (1814-26), 
                    based chiefly on drawings by J. M. W. Turner. Although the project was beset by delays, 
                    in the course of it Turner learned to treat engraving as an expressive medium in which he could play a collaborative role. 
                    W. B. Cooke was also instrumental in furthering Turner's contributions to steel engraving, by employing the mezzotint engraver, 
                    Thomas Goff Lupton (1791-1873), with whom Turner had already collaborated, and who was making successful breakthroughs 
                    in the practical use of the stubborn but durable medium. For these first Turner engravings on steel, Cooke commissioned the series, 
                    The Rivers of England (1823-27). This series was the occasion of the first serious falling out between Turner 
                    and the Cooke shop, over the question of whether Turner would "touch" (make improvements to) plates for the series based on drawings by another artist, 
                    Thomas Girtin (1775-1802). See Shanes, Turner's Rivers, Harbours and Coasts, 5-12).</p>
