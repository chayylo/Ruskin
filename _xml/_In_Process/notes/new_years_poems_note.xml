                <p>The two occasions that inspire poetry early in the Ruskin juvenilia and recur faithfully thoughout 
                    are <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s May 10 birthday and New Year&#x02BC;s. Of the latter kind of occasional poem, 
                    whether inscribed for presentation on New Year&#x02BC;s Eve or on New Year&#x02BC;s Day, the earliest surviving example is 
                    <!-- title and link to apparatus --><ref type="apparatus" target="time_blank_verse_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTIMEBLANKVERSE">&#x201C;Time: Blank Verse&#x201D;</title></ref>, which is dated ???

                    for a poem earlier than <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTIMEBLANKVERSE">&#x201C;Time: Blank Verse&#x201D;</title>, which may have been presented as a New Year&#x02BC;s present, 
                    although it contains no formal features of an occasional ode).</p>
                
                <p>A likely model for the New Year&#x02BC;s ode, which was available to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in the <placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName> library, 
                    was the <!-- title and link to note --><ref type="note" target="evangelical_magazine_note.php"><title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title></ref>, 
                    which regularly included New Year&#x02BC;s poems in the &#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; section for the January issue. Starting with the magazine&#x02BC;s volume 1 (<date when="1793">1793</date>), 
                    monthly issues featured a brief one&#x2010; to two&#x2010;page section, &#x201C;Poetry&#x201D;, consisting largely of contributions by readers, signed with initials or aliases. 
                    (The header for this section may have served <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> as a model for the &#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; anthologies in his <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRREDBOOK">Red Books</title>: see . . . ) 
                    Reader contributions in all departments were encouraged by the editors&#x2014;&#x201C;Short pieces will generally be most satisfactory&#x201D; 
                    (&#x201C;Preface&#x201D; [<date when="1794-01">January 1794</date>])&#x2014;and the supplementary issue ending volume 1 duly carried contributors&#x02BC; poems on the Nativity. 
                    For the following <date when="1794-01">January</date> issue of volume 2 (<date when="1794">1794</date>), contributors supplied poems on the New Year. Their themes, praising the <persName type="spiritual" corresp="#CREATOR">Creator</persName> for time and the seasons, 
                    and arguing the superiority of spiritual gifts over holiday presents, are more cheerful than a harangue in prose on the shortness of life, 
                    which features in the main body of the issue, urging the reader to solemnize one&#x02BC;s mind

                <p>When this family tradition started is uncertain. The earliest poem specifically
                    dated 1 January is . . .<!-- Entry needed here. --> and the earliest poem explicitly connected with New
                    Year&#x02BC;s Day is . . .<!-- Entry needed here. --> <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHENEEDLESSALARM">&#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D;</title> and
                    <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title> as a whole. . . . The <title type="anthology" corresp="#MSIIIPOETRYANTHOLOGY2">MS III Second Poetry Anthology</title> contains at least
                    three New Year&#x02BC;s Poems: <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTIMEBLANKVERSE">&#x201C;Time: Blank Verse,&#x201D;</title>
                    the previous year&#x02BC;s presentation, along with <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHESUN">&#x201C;The
                        Sun&#x201D;</title> and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D;
                    (&#x201C;Papa how pretty those icicles are&#x201D;)</title>. </p>
                <p>Typically the poems contained a New Year&#x02BC;s greeting, but
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JRGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Papa how pretty those
                    icicles are&#x201D;)</title> does not, suggesting that the relevance of a given
                    topic to the holiday may have been understood only by the family.</p>
                <p>One possible model for this practice was the Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s
                    annual, containing light verse and illustration, such as <hi rend="italic"
                        >Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi>.[When did the family start buying
                    annuals? Point out how anthologies following &#x201C;Harry and
                    Lucy&#x201D; may be imitating this.]<!-- Entry needed here. --> </p>
                <p> For a Scottish family, New Year&#x02BC;s Day . . . (What was the
                    celebration typically? Why New Year&#x02BC;s?) Ruskin would always treat
                    New Year&#x02BC;s as a red&#x2010;letter day connected with writing. . . .<!-- Entry needed here. --></p>
