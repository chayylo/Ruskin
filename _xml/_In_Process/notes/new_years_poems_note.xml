                <head type="title">New Year&#x02BC;s Poems</head>
                <p>The two occasions that inspire poetry early in the Ruskin juvenilia and recur faithfully thoughout 
                    are John James Ruskin's May 10 birthday and New Year&#x02BC;s. Of the latter kind of occasional poem, 
                    whether inscribed for presentation on New Year's Eve or on New Year's Day, the earliest surviving example is 
                    <!-- title and link to apparatus -->&#x201C;Time: Blank Verse&#x201D;, which is dated ??? 
                    (see also <!-- title and link to apparatus: discussioi -->&#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D;: Discussion, 
                    for a poem earlier than "Time: Blank Verse", which may have been presented as a New Year's present, 
                    although it contains no formal features of an occasional ode).</p>
                
                <p>A possible model for the New Year's ode, which was certainly available to Ruskih in the Herne Hill library, 
                    was the <!-- title and link to note -->Evangelical Magazine, 
                    which regularly included a small section of New Year's poems in the January issue. 
                    </p>
                <p>When this family tradition started is uncertain. The earliest poem specifically
                    dated 1 January is . . .<!-- Entry needed here. --> and the earliest poem explicitly connected with New
                    Year&#x02BC;s Day is . . .<!-- Entry needed here. --> &#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D; and
                    MS I as a whole. . . . The MS III Second Poetry Anthology contains at least
                    three New Year&#x02BC;s Poems: &#x201C;Time: Blank Verse,&#x201D;
                    the previous year&#x02BC;s presentation, along with &#x201C;The
                    Sun&#x201D; and &#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D;
                    (&#x201C;Papa how pretty those icicles are&#x201D;). </p>
                <p>Typically the poems contained a New Year&#x02BC;s greeting, but
                    &#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Papa how pretty those
                    icicles are&#x201D;) does not, suggesting that the relevance of a given
                    topic to the holiday may have been understood only by the family.</p>
                <p>One possible model for this practice was the Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s
                    annual, containing light verse and illustration, such as <hi rend="italic"
                        >Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi>.[When did the family start buying
                    annuals? Point out how anthologies following &#x201C;Harry and
                    Lucy&#x201D; may be imitating this.]<!-- Entry needed here. --> </p>
                <p> For a Scottish family, New Year&#x02BC;s Day . . . (What was the
                    celebration typically? Why New Year&#x02BC;s?) Ruskin would always treat
                    New Year&#x02BC;s as a red&#x2010;letter day connected with writing. . . .<!-- Entry needed here. --></p>
