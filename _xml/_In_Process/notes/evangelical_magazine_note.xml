                <p>In a letter of 3 March 1823 to John James Ruskin,
                    Margaret Ruskin mentions receiving this publication 
                    (Ruskin Family Letters, ed. Burd, 121). Her remark does not make clear when the Ruskins' subscription began, 
                    but it might be significant that, with the 1823 issues, the magazine initiated volume 1 of a new series.</p>
                <p>The Evangelical Magazine was founded in 1793 as a nondenominational voice of evangelical culture 
                    embracing Anglican Evangelicalism, Old Dissent, and New Dissent (Altbolz, Religious Press in Britain, 45). 
                    That spirit of pan-evangelical catholicity of nonaffiliation was reaffirmed at the start of the new series in 1823, 
                    but the position was being tested. A "Retrospect" admitted to the emergence of rival denominational publications 
                    on both the Anglican Evangelical and Congregational sides. In fact, the Evangelical Magazine's editorship itself 
                    became dominated by Congregationalists, like the organization it most prominently represented, 
                    the London Missionary Society (LMS) 
                    ("Retrospect of the Former Series of the Evangelical Magazine", 1; 
                    Altholz, Religious Press in Britain, 46).</p>
                <p>Regular reading of the Evangelical Magazine necessarily entailed an interest in missionary work,
                    since a significant portion of each issue was devoted to reporting missionary news. 
                    As Sujit Sivasundaram argues, the magazine offered readers a collective experience of evangelical zeal 
                    by reporting in detail on charitable contributions to the LMS, from small donations such as used copies of the magazine to be sent to missionaries abroad, 
                    to more substantial cash donations. Readers felt they participated in a worldwide evangelistic effort 
                    ("The Periodical as Barometer", 43-48). In the outreach for charitable support, the magazine formed part of the LMS's larger effort, 
                    which Anna Johnston describes as the construction of "a reading audience through its canny manipulation 
                    of textual and media technologies, a readership that would unite religious Britons in a common cause 
                    despite differences of class, region, gender, and age" ("British Missionary Publishing", 30). 
                    John Ruskin captures the excitement in ???, which appears to be a record of a meeting of a missionary society 
                    or perhaps a sermon on missionary efforts; and in his starstruck enthusiasm for the poetry and journals of 
                    Reginald Heber, Bishop of Calcutta.
                </p>
                <p>Besides missionary
                
                    The magazine supported other interests, as well, which would have engaged the Ruskin family, including 
                    poetry; articles primarily on religious topics but encompassing other areas of knowledge, such as natural history; 
                    reviews and notices of religious publications; obituaries and biographies of celebrated clergy, 
                    embellished by an engraved portrait of a clergyman in each issue; and as an effect of missionary news, 
                    exposure to peoples, landscapes, and customs of cultures around the world--an exposure that was of course 
                    filtered through the perception of the missionaries reporting on their experiences.</p>
