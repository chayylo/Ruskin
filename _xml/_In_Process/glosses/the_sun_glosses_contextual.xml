                    perhaps means that these heavenly bodies attend on the sun by following a path close to the sun's ecliptic. 
                    As the Tutor explains in Jeremiah Joyce's Scientific Dialogues, the moon "is always either in the ecliptic, 
                    or within five degrees and a third of it on one side or the other. The planets also, by which I mean, Mercury, 
                    Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the Herschel [Uranus], are never more than eight degrees distant from the line of the ecliptic". 
                    His pupil then asking to trace the ecliptic in relation to the fixed stars, the Tutor describes the constellations of the zodiac 
                    (Joyce, Scientific Dialogues, "Of Astronomy", conversation 3, "Of the Fixed Stars, and Ecliptic", 2:28-29). 
                    Ruskin, however, does not name constellations in the zodiac; instead, he names prominent constellations that, unlike those in the zodiac, 
                    never set, and that are commonly chosen as starting points in lessons about the night sky. Orion lies along the celestial equator. 
                    The rest are circumpolar constellations, revolving around the North Star (Polaris)--Ursa Major (Great Bear), 
                    of which the "Plough" or "Charles's Wain" form a part; 
                    Ursa Minor ("Lesser" Bear); and Corona Borealis (Northern Crown).
