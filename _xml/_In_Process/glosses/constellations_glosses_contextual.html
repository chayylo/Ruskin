Included among the forty‐eight constellations listed by <span class="persName">Ptolemy</span>.</p> 
               <p>According to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs geography text, “<span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Orion</span></span>, containing his Sword and luminous Belt”, is considered one of the “most remarkable”
                  constellations “to the naked eye or telescope”, along with “<span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Taurus</span></span>, containing the <span class="name">Pleiades</span>; and <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Ursa Major</span></span>, containing the <span style="font-style:italic">Pointers</span> to the <span class="name">North Star</span>: all visible in our winter evenings” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GOLDSMITHGEOGRAPHY"><span class="persName">Goldsmith</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Grammar of General Geography</span></span></a>, 8). Situated south of <span class="name">Taurus (the Bull)</span> and <span class="name">Gemini (the Twins, <span class="persName">Castor</span> and <span class="persName">Pollux</span>)</span>, which are constellations in the <span class="name">zodiac</span>, <span class="name">Orion</span> is viewed along the celestial equator, below the ecliptic. In the northern hemisphere,
                  it rises low on the eastern horizon during winter evenings and transits westward.</p> 
               <p>Among the most anciently named constellations, <span class="name">Orion</span> is mentioned, for example, in <span class="persName">Homer</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Odyssey</span></span> as one of the constellations that guide <span class="persName">Odysseus</span> (bk. 5), and he also appears to <span class="persName">Odysseus</span> among the dead in the underworld (bk. 11). In mythology, <span class="persName">Orion</span> is a great hunter. He “is represented on the globe by the figure of a man with a
                  sword in his belt, a club in his right hand, and the skin of a lion in his left; he
                  is said by some authors to be the son of <span class="persName">Neptune</span> and <span class="persName">Euryale</span>, a famous huntress; he possessed the disposition of his mother, became the greatest
                  hunter in the world, and boasted that there was not any animal on the <span class="name">earth</span> which he could not conquer”. However, “as a punishment for his temerity”, “in the
                  island of <span class="placeName">Crete</span>, accompanied by <span class="persName">Diana</span> and <span class="persName">Latona</span> in the chase, . . . he perished by the bite of a scorpion” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 53). Accordingly, “he was placed among the stars, in a position directly opposite
                  to that of the <span class="name">Scorpion</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 69; see <a class="link_ref" href="#SCORPIOGLOSS" title="High up there is scorpio (MS IA RF T70 MS III)Scorpio (Scorpion) constellation of the southern Zodiac (the second southern and ...">Scorpio</a>; and for other tales about the death of <span class="name">Orion</span>, see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 135).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Aspin</span> adds a biblical type, <span class="name">Orion</span> as the “representative of <span class="persName">Nimrod</span>, that ‘mighty hunter’, who is supposed to have been the author of the postdiluvian
                  heresy” (<span class="titlem">Gen. 10:8–9</span>; for <span class="persName">Nimrod</span> as a warrior king who cast off fear of <span class="persName">God</span> by shedding human blood and by organizing a great metropolis crowned by the <span class="placeName">Tower of Babel</span>, see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SCOTTBIBLE"><span class="titlem">Holy Bible</span>, ed. <span class="persName">Scott</span></a>, 1:62, 64). Aspin also mocks an unsuccessful attempt by “French astronomers” to “change
                  the name of this constellation to that of <span class="persName">Napoleon</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 147; for the <span class="orgName">University of Leipsig</span>ʼs flattery of <span class="persName">Napoleon</span> in <span class="date">1807</span>, following the Treaties of Tilsit ending the War of the <span class="orgName">Fourth Coalition</span>, by naming <span class="name">Orion</span>ʼs belt and sword after the emperor, see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ALLENSTARNAMES"><span class="persName">Allen</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Names</span></span></a>, ??).</p>

The iconography of seating the Olympian gods on thrones may have been most
                  familiar to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> from the synod of the gods in book 15 of <span class="persName">Homer</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Iliad</span></span>, which he knew in <span class="persName">Pope</span>ʼs translation. After <span class="persName">Jupiter</span> (Zeus) has rebuked <span class="persName">Juno</span> (Hera) for assisting the <span class="orgName">Trojans</span>, <span class="persName">Juno</span> provokes <span class="persName">Mars</span> (Ares) to resentful rage for the loss of his son, <span class="persName">Ascalaphus</span>. <span class="persName">Minerva</span> (Athena) “[s]tarts from her azure throne to calm the god”, reminding him of the futility
                  of striving against <span class="persName">Jove</span>, and “[t]his menace fixʼd the warrior to his throne; / Sullen he sat, and curbʼd
                  the rising groan” (bk. 15, lines 141, 160–61). This passage also pertains to the association
                  of <span class="persName">Mars</span> and <span class="persName">Venus</span> (Aphrodite), <span class="persName">Juno</span> having conspired with <span class="persName">Venus</span> in book 14 to distract <span class="persName">Jupiter</span> from the battlefield with love‐making and sleep (<span class="persName">Homer</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Iliad</span></span>, trans. <span class="persName">Pope</span>, 307, and see 303–7, 292–97).

Considered as part of the
                  larger constellation, the seven stars “form a quadrilateral figure in the back of
                  the Bear; the other three stars project from one of the angles in a curved line, and
                  constitute the tail”; however, the seven stars “occupy but a small part of the whole
                  constellation, which is one of the most extensive in the heavens” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 23).</p>

                  As <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Tutor</span> explains, “if you wish to be a young astronomer”, a youth “must learn to find these

                  of the <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Great Bear</span></span>”, which “some people have supposed . . . aptly represent a <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">plough</span></span>; others say, that they are more like a <span style="font-style:italic">waggon and horses;</span>—the four stars representing the body of the waggon, and the other three the horses”

               <p>Among the oldest named constellations in classical sources familiar to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, the <span class="name">Great Bear</span> is mentioned along with <span class="name">Orion</span> by <span class="persName">Homer</span> in the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Odyssey</span></span> (bk. 5) as ever‐present in the sky, never bathing in the sea. <span class="persName">Aspin</span> remarks “[i]ts use . . . by mariners from the earliest times that commerce has been

The best‐known story in western classical poetry about the <span class="name">Great Bear</span> is told by <span class="persName">Ovid</span> in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Metamorphoses</span></span>. The nymph <span class="persName">Callisto</span>, a companion of the huntress <span class="persName">Artemis [Diana]</span> is raped by <span class="persName">Zeus [Jupiter]</span>.

Included among the forty‐eight constellations listed by <span class="persName">Ptolemy</span>.</p> 
               <p>In mythology, “[b]y some writers the Dragon is represented as the monster which protected

                  It has since become an emblem of vigilance. Others maintain, that in a war with the
                  Giants, this Dragon was brought into the combat, and opposed to <span class="persName">Minerva [Athena]</span>, who threw it round the axis of the <span class="name">earth</span> before it had time to uncoil, where it remains to this day” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 23). <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> adds: “Whoever attends to the situation of <span class="name">Draco</span>, surrounding the <span class="name">Pole of the Ecliptic</span>, will perceive that its tortuous folds are symbolical of the oblique course of the

               <p>In <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs summary of the legend, “<span class="persName">Medusa</span> was one of the three Gorgons who had the power to turn into stones all those on whom
                  they fixed their eyes; <span class="persName">Medusa</span> was the only one subject to mortality: she was celebrated for the beauty of her locks,
                  but having violated the sanctity of the temple of <span class="persName">Minerva [Athena]</span>, that goddess changed her locks into serpents”. When the hero <span class="persName">Perseus</span> was charged by an envious king to slay the Gorgons, “<span class="persName">Pluto [Hades]</span>, the god of the infernal regions, lent him his helmet, which had the power of rendering
                  its bearer invisible; <span class="persName">Minerva</span>, the goddess of wisdom, furnished him with her buckler, which was resplendent as
                  glass; and he received from <span class="persName">Mercury</span> wings and a dagger, or sword; thus equipped, he cut off the head of <span class="persName">Medusa</span>, and from the blood which dropped from it in its passage through the air, sprang
                  an innumerable quantity of serpents, which ever after infested the sandy deserts of
                  <span class="placeName">Libya</span>”. On his return from this victory, <span class="persName">Perseus</span> found a maiden, <span class="persName">Andromeda</span>—represented by a constellation adjacent to <span class="name">Perseus</span>—who was “chained naked to a rock . . . to be devoured by a sea monster, in order
                  that her father <span class="persName">Cepheus</span> might still preserve his kingdom. <span class="persName">Perseus</span> turned the monster into a rock by shewing it the head of <span class="persName">Medusa</span>, and thus rescued <span class="persName">Andromeda</span>, whom he immediately took to wife, as the reward of her patriotism and filial piety”

               <p>In the first fair copy of his poem, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> scored through <span class="name">Medusaʼs Head</span> perhaps because the legend was deemed too gruesome for the Ruskin household. In illustrations
                  of <span class="name">Perseus et Caput Medusae</span> from the <span class="date">1820s</span>, <span class="persName">Green</span>ʼs artist tempers the horror by representing <span class="name">Perseus</span> holding the head of <span class="persName">Medusa</span> by her human hair, from which only a few serpents protrude, and the artist gives
                  her face a mild expression. In contrast, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Perseus</span> grips the head by its mass of writing serpents, and its face is fixed in its dangerous
                  gaze. The effect was not moderated when the plate was adapted for <span class="name">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span>, in which <span class="persName">Medusa</span>ʼs glare is even more sinister (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, pl. 4; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, pl. 3; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHURANIASMIRROR"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem">“Uraniaʼs Mirror”</span></a>, pl. 6).</p>

                  rather than ancient blood feuds. This constellation is now obsolete, but, in the <span class="date">first half of the 1820s</span>, it was acknowledged by <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="persName">Aspin</span>, and <span class="persName">Green</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 22; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Aspin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 105, 117–18; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 33).</p> 
               <p><span class="name">Telescopium Herschelii</span> was created in <span class="date">1789</span> by the Hungarian astronomer, <span class="persName">Maximilian Hell</span> (<span class="date">1720–92</span>), who devised it from “a few of the stars of <span class="name">Auriga [the Charioteer]</span>. . . . It is intended to perpetuate the name of <span class="persName">Herschell [William Herschel, <span class="date">1738–1822</span>]</span> and the form of the instrument by which he discovered the planet <span class="name">Uranus</span> in the year <span class="date">1781</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 33).

               <p><span class="persName">Ridpath</span> explains that <span class="persName">Hell</span> originally created two constellations commemorating <span class="persName">Herschel</span> telescopes, which were reduced to one by <span class="persName">Johann Bode</span> in <span class="date">1801</span>. Presumably, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> intended <span class="name">Telescopium Herschelii</span>, and not yet another constellation on the same theme, <span class="name">Telescopium (Telescope)</span>, which is a small formation in the southern hemisphere, and which remains an officially
                  recognized constellation today. It was created by the French astronomer, <span class="persName">Nicolas‐Louis de Lacaille</span> (<span class="date">1713–62</span>); and while there is no way to prove <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs intent, it is reasonable to assume that he meant to celebrate the constellation
                  honoring the British astronomer (see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 205–6, 167–68).</p>

                  (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Aspin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 128, 122).</p> 
               <p><span class="name">Vulcepula et Anser</span> was introduced by the Polish astronomer, <span class="persName">Johannes Hevelius</span> (<span class="date">1611–87</span>), who depicted it as a fox with a goose captured in its jaws. The haplessness of
                  the bird may account for <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs epithet of “stupid”, but by dividing the constellation in two <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> also avoids drawing attention to the gooseʼs fate. A precedent for separating the
                  fox from the goose extends back to <span class="persName">Hevelius</span> himself, who named the constellation both as a single entity, <span class="name">Vulpecula <span style="font-style:italic">cum</span> Anser</span>, and as two distinct entities, which were afterward sometimes reunited as <span class="name">Vulpecula <span style="font-style:italic">et</span> Anser</span>. Nowadays, the goose is omitted altogether, leaving only <span class="name">Vulpecula</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 182–83).</p> 
               <p>Perhaps a predatory and carnivorous fox offended nineteenth‐century sensibility, since
                  both <span class="persName">Aspin</span> and <span class="persName">Green</span> omit any mention of what is happening to the goose. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> not only separates the constellations, but also places <span class="name">Lepus (the Hare)</span> between them. If he intended to shield the <span class="name">goose</span> from the <span class="name">fox</span>, however, he undercut the effort by giving the <span class="name">hare</span> the epithet “timid” (“frightened” in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>). Similarly, his epithet for the <span class="name">goose</span>, “stupid”, robs the disadvantaged of sympathy, just as an implied parallel between
                  the <span class="name">Goose</span> and <span class="name">Medusa</span> and between the <span class="name">Fox</span> and <span class="name">Perseus</span> suggests a justified fate.</p>

After <span class="persName">Charles II</span> was restored to the throne, the purpose of his astronomer, <span class="persName">Halley</span>, in traveling to <span class="placeName">St. Helena</span> was, like the Frenchman <span class="persName">Lacaille</span> on his mission, to survey the southern sky, and he published his star catalogue,

               <p>Of the three sequentially named southern constellations—<span class="name">Crux</span>, <span class="name">Robur Carolinum</span>, and <span class="name">Crater</span>—only the last is regularly visible from <span class="placeName">London</span>. While <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs inclusion of the first two can be attributed to a sentiment for their legendary

                  to May. Its position in the sky might also account for his odd remark,  “Iʼll call
                  it <span class="persName">juno</span>ʼs cup”, since the quadrilateral figure forming the base of the cup by its brightest
                  stars could be difficult to distinguish from the quadrilateral figure formed by the

                  of the <span class="name">Zodiac</span>”, an over‐simplification of <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs history of the constellation.

               <p>In <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs drawing of <span class="name">Hercules</span>, he “endeavoured to combine” attributes of the heroʼs labors, which previous star
                  maps associated separately with the figure, by placing in the grip of the left hand
                  the “Apple Branch” of the <span class="placeName">Hesperides</span> coiled together with the three‐headed, dog‐faced <span class="name">Cerberus</span>. In the figureʼs right hand, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> retained the traditional club; and as a touch of his own, he “added the bow and quiver
                  of arrows” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 27, and see pl. 8). <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs claim to originality was somewhat exaggerated, since, according to <span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, in <span class="date">1721</span> an English cartographer, <span class="persName">John Senex</span> (<span class="date">1678–1740</span>), had already combined the branch of golden apples with the three‐headed serpent
                  to form the constellation <span class="name">Cerberus et Ramus</span>, which then was placed in <span class="name">Hercules</span>ʼs hand by <span class="persName">Johann Bode</span> in his <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranographia</span></span> (<span class="date">1801</span>) (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 190). <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs representation, however, was copied by <span class="persName">Aspin</span>ʼs and <span class="persName">Green</span>ʼs artists with decreasing specificity, the <span class="name">Cerberus</span> in the <span class="titlem">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span> illustration losing its canine features; and the Cerberus in the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span> version losing even its serpentine fierceness, the apple branch its apples, and <span class="name">Hercules</span> his archery gear.</p> 
               <p>In his prose account, <span class="persName">Green</span> unpacks the emblems: “It is stated by the mythologists, that [<span class="persName">Hercules</span>] brought upon <span class="name">earth</span> the three‐headed monster <span class="name">Cerberus</span>, which guarded the entrance to <span class="persName">Pluto</span>ʼs dominions. The victory which he obtained over <span class="name">Cerberus</span>, is thought by some to denote his control over his bad passions; for he is held out
                  by the ancients as a pattern of virtue and piety. His judicious choice of virtue,
                  in preference to pleasure, is admirably described by <span class="persName">Xenophon</span>”. As for the “Hesperidian branch, bearing the golden apples”, that story “is probably
                  of a more ancient date”, <span class="persName">Hercules</span> “procur[ing] some of these golden apples from the <span class="placeName">Hesperides</span>, by killing the <span class="name">Dragon [Draco]</span>”, which is nearby in the sky. Also, “the skin of a lion covers his head and shoulders.
                  This is the lion he killed in the forests in the neighbourhood of <span class="placeName">Nemæa</span>, and the celebrated Nemæan games were instituted to commemorate that event” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 46–47).</p>

               <p><span class="persName">Ridpath</span> explains that the name “probably comes from a Greek word meaning ‘noisy’ or ‘clamorous’,
                  referring to the herdsmanʼs shouts to his animals”; or, linking the etymology to <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span> inside <span class="name">Ursa Major</span>, the name is a word “from the ancient Greek meaning ‘ox‐driver’”. According to a
                  legend in <span class="persName">Eratosthenes</span> similar to a story associated with Ursa Minor, the constellation “represents <span class="persName">Arcas</span>, son of the god <span class="persName">Zeus</span> and his paramour <span class="persName">Callisto</span>, daughter of <span class="persName">King Lycaon</span> of <span class="placeName">Arcadia</span>”.

               <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> returns to the southern hemisphere of constellations, again drawn seemingly by sentiment
                  (see also <a class="link_ref" href="#CRUXGLOSS" title="the blessed cross (RF T70 MS III)Unless Ruskin mistook as a separate constellation what is often called the Cross or Northern C..."><span class="name">Crux [the Southern Cross]</span></a> and <span class="name">Robur Carolinum [Charlesʼs Oak]</span>). In this case, however, the identification of his sentiment with an English name,
                  the <span style="font-style:italic">Swallow</span>, puts in doubt what constellation he intended. The name “swallow” appears in the
                  first draft, <span class="titlem">MS IA</span>, and in the fair copy, <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>. In the latter, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> struck through the name and substituted “sweet hirundo” (<span style="font-style:italic">hirundo</span> is the Latin name for the species including swallows), which he carried over to the
                  final fair copy, <span class="titlem">MS III</span>. Neither of these names, <span style="font-style:italic">swallow</span> nor <span style="font-style:italic">hirundo</span>, is used either in todayʼs star charts or in <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs chart published in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs time.</p> 
               <p>The names <span style="font-style:italic">Swallow</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Hirundo</span> did have currency, a constellation called “Hirundo, the Swallow” appearing in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">An Introduction to Astronomy Intended for Little Children</span> (<span class="date">1817</span>)</span> by <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> (<span class="date">1775–1851</span>). It is listed under the heading “The New Constellations to the South of the Ecliptic”,
                  between <span class="name">“Grus, the Crane”</span> and <span class="name">“Indus, the Indian”</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Sherwood</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Introduction to Astronomy</span></span></a>, 17). According to <span class="persName">Richard Hinckley Allen</span>, the constellation <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Apus</span></span> may have acquired the name the <span style="font-style:italic">Swallow</span> by way of the common English name for <span class="persName">Linnaeus</span>ʼs species name, <span style="font-style:italic">Hirundo apus</span>, which is also applied to the swift‐birds associated with the approach of summer
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ALLENSTARNAMES"><span class="persName">Allen</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Names</span></span></a>, 44). As a gloss for <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs listing, however, <span class="persName">Allen</span>ʼs explanation is contradicted by her <span style="font-style:italic">separate</span> listing of <span class="name">“Apus, or Avis Indica, the Bird of Paradise”</span>, which appears at the end of the list, following <span class="name">“Triangulum Australe, the Southern Triangle”</span>. If <span class="persName">Allen</span> is correct that <span style="font-style:italic">Hirundo apus</span> became confused with the constellation name, <span class="name">Apus</span>, it is understandable that <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> would nonetheless have decided that a constellation named after the common English
                  <span class="name">swallow</span> could be the same constellation known as <span class="name">Apus</span> or <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Apus Indica</span></span> or (in English) <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Bird of Paradise</span></span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 63, pl. 28). A probable conclusion, then, is that <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> doubled the same constellation under two different names, and that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, insofar as he understood what he meant at all, was pointing to <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Apus</span></span> in the southern hemisphere.</p> 
               <p>The constellation <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Apus, or Apus Indica</span></span>, which is associated with the family of exotic birds commonly known as <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">birds of paradise</span></span>, was one among twelve southern constellations introduced to European sky charts in
                  the <span class="date">late sixteenth century</span>, based on observations of the sky south of the equator the Dutch navigators, <span class="persName">Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser</span> and <span class="persName">Frederick de Houtman</span>. The name <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Apus</span></span> was derived from the Greek for <span style="font-style:italic">without foot</span>, since, as <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> explains, specimens originally obtained from <span class="placeName">New Guinea</span> by Europeans were skins from which the birdsʼ feet had been removed, leading to speculation
                  that these fabulous birds, with their long and colorful plummage, remained permanently
                  in flight (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 41).</p>

               <p>Intentionally or not, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs epithet "keen‐eyed" is related to the constellationʼs origin, an invention by <span class="persName">Hevelius</span> in <span class="date">1687</span>.

               <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs first epithet, “king”, as drafted in <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> and fair‐copied in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, is more appropriate to <span class="name">Leo</span>ʼs mythological associations than his second epithet, “generous”, as substituted in
                  <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> and fair‐copied in <span class="titlem">MS III</span>. As <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> summarizes, “[p]opular tradition represents the Lion, an animal remarkable for his
                  fierceness and strength, as emblematical of the <span class="name">Sun</span>ʼs heat at this period of the year” in advanced summer (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 40).</p> 
               <p>Mythologically, <span class="name">Leo</span> is associated with the terrible Lion of <span class="placeName">Nemea</span>, which <span class="persName">Hercules</span> defeated as the first of his twelve labors. After <span class="persName">Hercules</span> was sucessful, he made a cloak of the Lionʼs skin, which was said to be impervious
                  to weapons, and the lionʼs head of the cloak rested atop Herculesʼs own head (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 112).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Green</span> uses the constellation to highlight the <span class="titlem">Zodiac of Dendera</span>, an artifact removed from an ancient building by <span class="persName">Napoleon</span>ʼs agents during the campaign in <span class="placeName">Egypt</span>, and brought to <span class="placeName">Paris</span> to be installed in the <span class="orgName">Royal Library</span> (<span class="persName">Green</span> says the <span class="placeName">Louvre</span>) in <span class="date">1822</span>. <span class="persName">Green</span> notes that the constellations carved on the disk start from <span class="name">Leo</span>, rather than from <span class="name">Aries</span>, normally treated as the first sign of the <span class="name">Zodiac</span> owing to its association with the vernal equinox. Writing on the constellation <span class="name">Aries</span>, <span class="persName">Green</span> is skeptical of “those who are desirous of drawing from every source an argument
                  against the chronology of the <span class="titlem">Bible</span>, that these <span class="name">zodiacs</span> were constructed when the <span class="name">sun</span> entered the sign <span class="name">Leo</span>, which must have been more than ten thousand years before the birth of our <span class="persName">Saviour</span>”. <span class="persName">Green</span> aligns with the views of <span class="persName">Thomas Chalmers</span> (<span class="date">1780–1847</span>): “There are, perhaps, no opinions more diametrically opposed to each other, than
                  those of theorizing antiquaries. On almost every important question the contending
                  parties, in point of numbers and reputation, neutralize themselves; and what <span class="persName">Dr. Chalmers</span> has said in his <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evidences of Christianity</span></span> relative to speculating geologists, may justly be applied to them. ‘Though our imaginations
                  have been regaled by the brilliancy of their speculations, they are so opposite to
                  each other, that we now cease to be impressed by their evidence’” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 76, 64–65).</p>  
               <p>In <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Discourses on the Christian Revelation Viewed in Connection with the Modern Astronomy</span></span> (<span class="date">1817</span>), <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> sought to refute skeptical arguments that the evidence of astronomy undermines the
                  truth of Christian revelation. A copy of the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Discourses</span></span> was in the Ruskin family library (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><span class="persName">Dearden</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Library of John Ruskin</span></span></a>, 67 [no. 473]). <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> instead proposes, according to <span class="persName">David Cairns</span>, “such a relevance between the knowledge which the sciences present to us”—even the
                  presentiment by modern astronomy of a forbiddingly vast and violent universe—and the
                  convictions of faith that <span class="persName">Cairns</span> deems the discourses as constituting a natural theology (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#CAIRNSCHALMERSASTRONOMICAL"><span class="titlem">“Thomas Chalmersʼ Astronomical Discourses”</span></a>, 417).</p> 
               <p>As <span class="persName">Jonathan R. Topham</span> has carefully argued, however, evangelicals such as <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> were not typically receptive to the optimistic version of natural theology that <span class="persName">William Paley (<span class="date">1743–1805</span>)</span> influentially presented, with its evidences of a benevolent <span class="persName">Creator</span> as watchmaker, yet many evangelicals—especially Scottish evangelicals—remained open
                  to a “theology of nature”, which advocated “a rational religion that would attract the cultured middle classes, while maintaining a scriptural and soteriological emphasis distinct from the largely ethical emphasis” of natural
                  theology. <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> arrived at this approach following a transformative conversion experience, resulting
                  in an essay widely disseminated in <span class="date">1814</span> as <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evidence and Authority of the Christian Revelation</span></span>, which is the text mentioned by <span class="persName">Green</span>. Written after he underwent an evangelical conversion, <span class="persName">Chalmers</span>ʼs approach to evidences of the truth of <span class="orgName">Christianity</span>, In it, <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> pursues an “inductive Baconian “science of theology . . . based strictly on historical evidence. 
                  This comprised chiefly the ‘external evidence’ of the truth of the Christian revelation (the miracles and prophecies attending it), 
                  but also included . . . the ‘internal evidence’, namely the ‘marks of truth’ in the <span class="titlem">New Testament</span> considered as a human composition,  and the evidence provided by the text as to the character of its authors. These inferences were sound, he argued, since they were based on observations of human nature, of which people have much empirical experience”.
                  By comparison, <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> considered a Paleyan natural theology that judged “the truth of <span class="orgName">Christianity</span> on the reasonableness of its doctrines,  or any supposed agreement between the nature of the Christian religion and the character of the supreme being”
                  to be reliant  “on a priori speculation, and . . . consequently strictly anti‐Baconian and unscientific”.
                  We have “no experience whatever” of the “invisible <span class="persName">God</span>”, he argued, and his government must consequently be a subject “inaccessible to our faculties”
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#TOPHAMCHALMERS"><span class="persName">Topham</span>, <span class="titlem">“Science, Natural Theology, and Evangelicalism in Early Nineteenth‐Century Scotland”</span></a>, 144, 149, 155).</p> 
               <p>This method of turning the tables of scientific rigor on the moderates and the skeptics
                  is maintained in the Astronomical Discourses, <span class="persName">Topham</span> remarks, despite these lecturesʼ apparent kinship with natural theology. Ultimately,
                  <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> concludes, the “sense of wonder engendered by contemplation of the astonishing phenomena of astronomy had no power to impel .
                  . . to true religion.  Even if such contemplation could lead an atheist to a belief in ‘the design and authority of a great presiding Intelligence’”,
                  <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> wrote, “it could never by itself lead him to obedience to the divine will, or humble him ‘to acquiesce in the doctrine of that revelation which comes to his door with such a host of evidence, 
                  as even his own philosophy cannot bid away’. It was ‘only by insisting on the moral claim of <span class="persName">God</span> to a right of government over His creatures’  that the preacher could carry his hearers to ‘loyal submission to the will of <span class="persName">God</span>. Let him keep by this single argument’, <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> insisted,  ‘and then . . . he may bring convincingly home upon his hearers all the varieties of <span class="orgName">Christian</span> doctrine’. In his insistence that the preacherʼs appeal to the human conscience was essential to impel the atheist to consider the historical evidences”,
                  <span class="persName">Topham</span> summarizes, “and in his insistence that this argument was infinitely more powerful than any argument from external nature, we see a clear indication of <span class="persName">Chalmers</span>ʼs developing views” toward a rational religion consistent with his evangelicalism

            <div class="note" id="MUSCAGLOSS"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><p><span style="font-weight:bold">“the little <span class="name">fly“</span> (<span class="titlem">MS IA</span>; <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>; <span class="titlem">MS III</span>)—</span>As Ridpath explains, two constellations named <span class="name">Musca (Fly)</span> existed for a time, one in the southern hemisphere and one in the north. The earlier
                  claim belonged to the southern constellation, situated immediately south of <span class="name">Crux (the Southern Cross)</span>, and included among the twelve constellations that <span class="persName">Plancius</span> devised in <span class="date">1598</span>, based on observations by his fellow Dutchmen, <span class="persName">Keyser</span> and <span class="persName">de Houtman</span> during their exploration of the Indies. Initially, <span class="persName">Plancius</span> left the constellation unnamed—elsewhere, it was called by the Dutch word for <span style="font-style:italic">fly</span>, De Vlieghe—and then in <span class="date">1612</span>, <span class="persName">Plancius</span> called it by the Greek word for <span style="font-style:italic">fly</span>, Muia. Meanwhile, <span class="persName">Johannes Bayer</span> added to the confusion by labeling the constellation as <span class="name">Apis (the Bee)</span> in his <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranometria</span></span> (<span class="date">1603</span>), mistaking the representation of the insect. That name stuck alongside <span class="name">Musca</span>—<span class="persName">Ridpath</span> showing, for example, <span class="name">Apis</span> attached to the constellation as late as <span class="date">1801</span> in <span class="persName">Johann Bode</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranographia</span></span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 126–27).</p> 
               <p>The <span class="name">northern Musca</span>—which once buzzed above the back of <span class="name">Aries</span>, but is now obsolete as a constellation—was likewise originally the creation of <span class="persName">Plancius</span> in <span class="date">1612</span>, but he called it the Bee. In <span class="date">1687</span>, in what seems in retrospect a <span class="date">seventeenth‐century</span> astronomersʼ gag, <span class="persName">Hevelius</span> renamed it <span class="name">Musca</span>. <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> shows this name used for the northern insect‐constellation in <span class="persName">Bode</span>ʼs <span class="date">1801</span> atlas—naturally so, since <span class="persName">Bode</span> reserved <span class="name">Apis</span> for the name of the southern counterpart (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 198–99).</p> 
               <p>The details of this confusion matter since they may be helpful in identifying <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs source. His poem identifies <span class="name">“the little fly”</span> at line 34 and <span class="name">“the armed bee”</span> at line 48. Presumably, therefore, his source named two constellations, one named
                  <span class="name">Musca, or the Fly</span> and the other <span class="name">Apis, or the Bee</span>, a combination suggesting <span class="persName">Bode</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranographia</span></span> or a derivative. <span class="persName">Bode</span>ʼs atlas or a related source would place <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="name">Musca, or the Fly</span> in the northern hemisphere, within the border of <span class="name">Aries</span>. A northern identification cannot be confirmed in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem with certainty, given his caveat noted in <span class="titlem">MS III</span>, “[t]hese constellations though they are next in this poetry are not next in the
                  sky”. In the poem, the <span class="name">Fly</span> is said to be “next to” <span class="name">Camelopardalis</span>, which is named in line 33, and the <span class="name">Fly</span> is followed by the lines on <span class="name">Serpens</span>/<span class="name">Ophiuchus</span> (line 35) and <span class="name">Aries</span> (line 36). While <span class="name">Musca</span> is not directly “next to” <span class="name">Camelopardalis</span> or <span class="name">Ophiuchus</span> in the sky or in any star atlas, the northern hemisphere is strongly suggested, and
                  the nearly adjacent mention of <span class="name">Aries</span> seems to clinch the identification of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs Fly with <span class="persName">Bode</span>ʼs northern <span class="name">Musca</span>.</p> 
               <p>An available British derivative of <span class="persName">Bode</span>ʼs atlas for <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> would have been <span class="persName">Alexander Jamieson</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span> or the set of thirty‐two constellation cards based on <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs plates for the childʼs toy, <span class="name">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span>. Both sources even lent emphasis to <span class="name">Musca</span> by specifying the northern Fly as <span class="name">Musca Borealis</span>, a distinction that, according to <span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span> was the first to publish (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 199). In <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs plate 13, <span class="titlem">“Aries, and Musca Borealis”</span>, the <span class="name">Fly</span> is illustrated prominently within the border of the <span class="name">Ram</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 35, pl. 13). For a young audience of <span class="name">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span>, that plate was imitated as card 16, <span class="titlem">“Aries and Musca Borealis”</span>; moreover, the stars of <span class="name">“Musca”</span> are identified on card 5, <span class="titlem">“Gloria Frederici, Andromeda”</span>, and on card 6, <span class="titlem">“Perseus and Caput Medusae”</span> (for images of the cards, see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHURANIASMIRROR"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem">“Uraniaʼs Mirror”</span></a>).</p> 
               <p>The source of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="name">“armed bee”</span> is more elusive in <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, with <span class="name">Apis</span> engraved only as a small figure in <span class="titlem">plate 28</span>, which shows the map of the entire southern celestial hemisphere. The figure is not
                  labeled in the plate; and since <span class="name">Apis</span> is excluded altogether from the plates showing close‐up sectors of the southern hemisphere,
                  it goes unacknowledged in <span class="name">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span>. In the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span>, however, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> does allow <span class="name">Apis</span> its due, as the very last description of a constellation given in the text. <span class="name">“Musca Australis, the Southern Fly, or Bee”</span>, he calls it; and in the annotation, he bestows a royal coloring on the creature
                  that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> would have appreciated, given his admiration of monarchs as well as his tendency
                  to ransack the southern constellations for British associations: “The introduction
                  of the <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Bee</span></span> among the Celestial Host is a pretty idea, as well on account of the natural qualities
                  of this most extraordinary insect, as on account of its being the old hieroglyphic
                  of royalty. Of the insentient part of animated nature, the Bee is prince and chief
                  for foresight, ingenuity, industry, and fidelity: it was thence the fittest symbol
                  of a good king” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 63).</p> 
               <p>This evidence is not absolute, however, since <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> could have derived both of his constellation names from <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">An Introduction to Astronomy Intended for Little Children</span></span> (<span class="date">1817</span>)</a> by <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> (<span class="date">1775–1851</span>), which lists <span class="name">Musca, the Bee, or Fly</span> among “The New Constellations to the North of the Ecliptic”, while including <span class="name">Apis, the Bee</span> among “The New Constellations to the South of the Ecliptic”.

                  is divided into two parts, one of which is assigned to <span class="name">Ophiuchus</span> and the other to <span class="name">Serpens</span>. . . . According to ancient tradition, . . . [the human] figure represents the celebrated

Put another way by <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, the intertwining of <span class="name">Serpent</span> and <span class="name">Serpent Bearer</span> forms “the symbol of medicine, and of the gods who presided over this art”, although
                  he adds naturalistically that “the reptile may also be the symbol of prudence and

               <p><span class="persName">Ridpath</span> relates a story explaining the connection between snakes and healing: “On one occasion
                  in <span class="placeName">Crete</span>, <span class="persName">Glaucus</span>, the young son of <span class="persName">King Minos</span>, fell into jar of honey while playing and drowned. As <span class="persName">Asclepius [Aesculapius]</span> contemplated the body of <span class="persName">Glaucus</span>, a snake slithered towards it. He killed the snake with his staff; then another snake
                  came along with a herb in its mouth and placed it on the body of the dead snake, which
                  magically returned to life. <span class="persName">Asclepius</span> took the same herb and laid it on the body of <span class="persName">Glaucus</span>, who too was magically resurrected” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 130).</p>

About four thousand years ago, the vernal equinoctial point entered
                  this sign; but from its apparent motion towards the west, owing to the precession
                  of the equinoxes, it [the vernal equinox] is now found in the sign <span class="name">Pisces</span>, within which it has remained about 2000 years”. According to <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> writing in <span class="date">1822</span>, the <span class="name">sun</span> then entered <span class="name">Pisces</span> on about <span class="date">6 March</span> and <span class="name">Aries</span> on about <span class="date">22 April</span>. Thus, the vernal equinox, which falls on 20–21 March, occurs when the ecliptic appears
                  oriented toward <span class="name">Pisces</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 63); <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 50, 35).</p> 
               <p>As <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> describes “the vernal equinox, the first day of Spring [in the northern hemisphere],
                  and the commencement of the astronomical year”, which formerly was ushered in by the
                  <span class="name">earth</span>ʼs orientation toward <span class="name">Aries</span> in the planetʼs annual rotation around the <span class="name">sun</span>, “[i]t is then the beginning of day at the North Pole, the end of day at the South
                  Pole, and at this period the days and nights are equal, all over the globe except
                  at the Poles. . . . The North Pole is just coming into the light, and the <span class="name">Sun</span> is vertical to the Equator, which, together with the tropic of <span class="name">Cancer</span>, the parallel of <span class="placeName">London</span>, and the arctic circle, are all equally cut by the circle bounding light and darkness;
                  and hence the equality which reigns in all places in respect to the length of day

               <p><span class="persName">Green</span> relates the legend associated with the Ram, “which bore the golden fleece. <span class="persName">Nephele</span>, queen of <span class="placeName">Thebes</span>, mother to <span class="persName">Phryxus</span> and <span class="persName">Helle</span>, being apprized of some murderous designs against her children, gave them this ram,
                  on whose back they were to be carried through the air to their friend <span class="persName">Aetes</span>, king of <span class="placeName">Colchis</span>. The rapid motion of the ram during their flight, and their elevation above the <span class="name">earth</span>, made <span class="persName">Helle</span> giddy, and she dropped from the back of the ram into that part of the sea which was
                  afterwards called the <span class="geogName">Hellespont [the Dardanelles]</span>. <span class="persName">Phryxus</span> arrived safe at his destination.

In gratitude to the goddess, <span class="persName">Erichtonius</span> instituted games known as the Panathenaea (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 50).</p> 
               <p>In other accounts, <span class="name">Boötes</span>, in his role of driving the wagon in <span class="name">Ursa Major</span>, is credited with the invention of chariots, whereas <span class="name">Auriga</span> is associated with the story of another chariot racer, <span class="persName">Myrtilus</span>. “Mirtilius, a son of Mercury and Phaetusa, . . . was charioteer to <span class="persName">Oenomaus</span>, king of <span class="placeName">Pisa</span>, in Elis, and so skilled in riding and the management of horses, that he rendered
                  the steeds of his lord the swiftest in <span class="placeName">Greece</span>; but his infidelity to his master proved at last fatal to him” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 21). As <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> goes on to explain, thanks to <span class="persName">Myrtilus</span>ʼs horse training, his king was able to fend off suitors to his beautiful daughter,
                  <span class="persName">Hippodamia</span>, by challenging them to a race in which the penalty was death. After a dozen challengers
                  had met their death, another suitor won <span class="persName">Hippodamia</span>ʼs love, leading her to persuade <span class="persName">Myrtilus</span> to tamper with the kingʼs chariot. <span class="persName">Myrtilus</span> agreed since he was in love with the girl himself, and so the king was killed in
                  the race instead of the suitor. For his pains, <span class="persName">Myrtilus</span> was murdered by the jealous suitor, explaining his sad lack of a chariot in the sky.
                  (To this tale, <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> adds a third, mentioned by neither <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> nor <span class="persName">Green</span>; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 50–51).</p>

In the sea,
                  off the island of <span class="placeName">Euboea</span>, <span class="persName">Poseidon</span> “built himself a magnificent underwater palace”, which, “for all its opulence, .
                  . . felt empty without a wife, so . . . he courted <span class="persName">Amphitrite</span>, one of the group of sea nymphs called <span class="persName">Nereids</span>”. When <span class="persName">Amphitrite</span> fled <span class="persName">Poseidon</span>ʼs advances, he sent the dolphin as a messenger, who, “with soothing gestures brought
                  her back to the sea god”, and who “in gratitude <span class="persName">Poseidon</span> placed . . . among the stars” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 88–89).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Green</span> links the constellation to a story about another dolphin,““which saved the life of
                  <span class="persName">Arion</span>, the famous lyric poet and musician of <span class="placeName">Lesbos</span>. . . . <span class="persName">Arion</span>, who had obtained immense riches in <span class="placeName">Italy</span> by his professional skill, resolved to return with his wealth to his native country.
                  The sailors of the ship in which he had embarked, determined to murder him to obtain
                  his riches. Aware of their infamous designs, he begged to be permitted before his
                  death to play some melodious tunes, which as soon as he had finished he threw himself
                  into the sea. A number of Dolphins had been attracted round the ship by the sweetness
                  of the music, and it is said that one of them supported <span class="persName">Arion</span> on his back, and brought him safe to land. Whatever may have given rise to this story,
                  the ancients agree in representing the <span class="name">Dolphin</span> as the friend and protector of man” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 58–59). This story, <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> explains, was passed down by <span class="persName">Hyginus</span> and <span class="persName">Ovid</span>, and the responsibility for placing <span class="name">Dolphin</span> among the constellations was ascribed to <span class="persName">Apollo</span>, god of music and poetry.

                  any mythology attached to the constellation (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 62; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 86).</p> 
               <p>From the time of <span class="persName">Ptolomy</span>, the altar was imagined with its base oriented to the north and with flames rising
                  from its top, oriented to the southern pole, and those visual elements were carried
                  into modern representations (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 47). It seems not just the depiction of flames, however, that moved <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, to insert the epithet <span class="name">“gods fire”</span> in the line as originally drafted in <span class="titlem">MS IA</span>; rather, his phrase suggests that he was forestalling association with the pagan
                  rites involved in the myths originally connected with the <span class="name">Altar</span>. The phrase “godʼs fire” imposes a <span class="orgName">Christian</span> typology on the altar flames, referring, e.g., to <span class="titlem">Leviticus 6:12–13</span>: “And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it, it shall not be put out: and
                  the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and he shall burn thereon the fat
                  of the peace‐offerings. The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar: it shall never
                  go out”. In a commentary on the passage in his popular annotated <span class="titlem">Bible</span>, <span class="persName">Thomas Scott</span> (<span class="date">1747–1821</span>) reads the Levitical rites as a type of the permanence of <span class="persName">God</span>ʼs justice and <span class="persName">Christ</span>ʼs redemption: just as “the fire on the altar was kindled from heaven”, <span class="persName">Scott</span> explains, “and it must not be suffered to go out” causing it to “be replaced by ordinary
                  fire”, so “this fire was an intended type of the eternal avenging justice of <span class="persName">God</span>, and the perpetual efficacy of <span class="persName">Christ</span>ʼs all‐sufficient atonement” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SCOTTBIBLE"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Holy Bible . . . with Explanatory Notes, Practical Observations, and Copious Marginal
                           References</span></span>, by <span class="persName">Thomas Scott</span></a>, 1:345–46).</p> 
               <p>As an example of how the Leviticus verse was applied as a historical type from <span class="titlem">Old Testament</span> to <span class="titlem">New</span> in Evangelical discourse, a writer for the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evangelical Magazine</span></span> cites “the watchfulness of the [Levite] ministers of the sanctuary—to preserve the
                  sacred fire on the altar. As this was kindled from heaven, and it was unlawful to
                  offer strange fire; the Levites watched to preserve the sacred flame from extinction,
                  by supplying it with fuel night and day. In this way <span class="persName">God</span> taught his ancient people the duty of watchfulness and incessant prayer, by rites
                  and ceremonies, which accorded with the genius of that dispensation when the church
                  was under age. But now that it is come to its majority, our <span class="persName">Lord</span> instructs us in a more manly way, by addresses to our judgment, conscience, and hearts,
                  which should lead us to . . . Watchfulness and Prayer” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#MEDITATIONSEVANGELICALMAG1835-12"><span class="titlem">“Meditations on Mark XIII.33”</span></a>, 489).</p> 
               <p>Whether <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> and <span class="persName">Green</span> remained strategically silent about the stories surrounding <span class="name">Ara</span>, fearing to touch sacred things, or they considered the small constellation too minor
                  and too far south for English observers to merit a lengthy description, for ancient
                  writers this altar in the sky ranked as “a special one”, according to <span class="persName">Ridpath</span>. As described by both the Greek writer, <span class="persName">Eratosthenes</span>, and the Roman writer, <span class="persName">Manilius</span>, this altar was “used by the gods themselves to swear a vow of allegiance before
                  their fight against the Titans”. According to legend, <span class="persName">Cronus</span>—the chief of the most ancient gods, the giant Titans—swallowed all his children in
                  an attempt to thwart a prophesy that they would grow up to overthrow him. To prevent
                  this fate befalling the latest child, <span class="persName">Zeus</span>, <span class="persName">Cronus</span>ʼs wife, <span class="persName">Rhea</span>, sent the infant to <span class="placeName">Crete</span> to be hidden in a cave. Meanwhile, she deceived <span class="persName">Cronus</span> by giving him a rock to swallow in place of the infant god. When <span class="persName">Zeus</span> had grown to maturity, he returned from <span class="placeName">Crete</span> and forced his father to vomit his siblings—<span class="persName">Hestia</span>, <span class="persName">Demeter</span>, <span class="persName">Hera</span>, <span class="persName">Hades</span>, and <span class="persName">Poseidon</span>—who were now also fully grown. Together, the new generation of gods vowed on the
                  altar, <span class="name">Ara</span>, to battle against <span class="persName">Cronus</span> and the Titans until defeating and overtaking the rule by the ancient gods (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 46–47; and see <a class="link_ref" href="AQUILAGLOSS"><span class="name">Aquila [the Eagle]</span></a> and <a class="link_ref" href="AURIGAGLOSS"><span class="name">Auriga [the Charioteer]</span></a>).</p>

                  as his lessons in physics derived from <span class="persName">Jeremiah Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span> and <span class="persName">Maria Edgeworth</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</span></span>, in which air pumps figure prominently as an experimental and instructional device

               <p><span class="persName">Lacaille</span> intended the constellation, which he first named <span class="name">Machine Pneumatique</span>, as a tribute to experimental physics; and as <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> notes, <span class="persName">Lacaille</span>ʼs initial representation was based on the early single‐cylinder type of air pump
                  used by physicists in the <span class="date">seventeenth century</span>. By the time of <span class="persName">Bode</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranographia</span> (<span class="date">1801</span>)</span>, the representation of <span class="name">Antlia</span> was modernized to the double‐cylinder type of pump, which eighteenth‐century physicists

               <p>Given <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs familiarity with the air pump through his reading, it is puzzling that he substituted
                  a constellation associated with geometry, which he is not known to have studied during
                  this period. <span class="name">“Euclidʼs Square”</span> is a translation of the Latin name Quadra Euclidis, which in turn is an alternate
                  name for <span class="name">Norma et Regula (Square and Rule)</span>.

                  (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 19–20). <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs ringing endorsement of <span class="persName">Perseus</span>ʼs “patriotism and filial piety” meets with some dissonance in more a extended version
                  of his myth, in which he is prophesied to kill his grandfather and eventually does
                  so. He is the enemy of tyrants, however, and the constant protector of his mother
                  and stepfather (see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 140–42).</p> 
               <p>Versions of the myth differ in classical sources, which are variously retold in the
                  star atlases. In the version told by <span class="persName">Hyginus</span> in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Fabulae</span></span>, <span class="persName">Andromeda</span> is already promised as a bride before <span class="persName">Perseus</span> rescues her. In <span class="persName">Green</span>ʼs telling of this version, “[a]fter being promised in marriage by her father [<span class="persName">Cepheus</span>] to her uncle, <span class="persName">Phineus</span>, [<span class="persName">Andromeda</span>] gave herself up to be devoured by a sea monster”. Following her rescue, “<span class="persName">Cepheus</span>, her father, then betrothed her to <span class="persName">Perseus</span>. This contemplated union was violently opposed by <span class="persName">Phineus</span>, who, after a furious battle with his rival, was converted into a stone by the wonder
                  working head of the <span class="persName">Gorgon</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 40). In <span class="persName">Ovid</span>ʼs version, which may have been a source for <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs telling, there is no betrothal previous to <span class="persName">Perseus</span>ʼs; rather, <span class="persName">Perseus</span>, so amazed by <span class="persName">Andromeda</span>ʼs beauty that he at first mistakes the chained figure for a marble statue, calls
                  on <span class="persName">Cepheus</span> and <span class="persName">Cassiopeia</span> to accept him as a son‐in‐law before he saves the maiden. Their consent readily granted,
                  <span class="persName">Perseus</span> accepts the modest and compliant <span class="persName">Andromeda</span> without asking a dower and returns home. <span class="persName">Ovid</span>ʼs version is not <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs source for battle with <span class="name">Cetus</span>, however. In <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Metamorphoses</span></span>, <span class="persName">Perseus</span> slays <span class="name">Cetus</span> with the sword bestowed by the gods rather than turning it to stone with <span class="persName">Medusa</span>ʼs head. Instead, <span class="persName">Perseus</span> lays the head aside on a bed of seaweed, which soaks up the venom and hardens, accounting
                  for the origin of coral.</p>

The Greeks feigned the emblem of this sign to be
                  also <span class="persName">Astraea</span>, the goddess ofjustice; and their poets further affirmed her to be <span class="persName">Erigone</span>, daughter of <span class="persName">Icarius</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 42). A correction is supplied by <span class="persName">Ridpath</span>: “She is usually identified as <span class="persName">Dike</span>, goddess of justice, who was the daughter of <span class="persName">Zeus</span> and <span class="persName">Themis</span>; but she is also known as <span class="persName">Astraeia</span>, daughter of <span class="persName">Astraeus</span> (father of the stars) and <span class="persName">Eos</span> (goddess of the dawn)” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 179).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Green</span> relays a story about <span class="name">Virgo</span> as a goddess of justice: “Some say that the Virgin here placed in the skies was,
                  while on <span class="name">earth</span>, <span class="persName">Justitia</span>, who lived in the golden age and taught mankind their duty; but who, when their crimes

Because of this abandonment of mankind, <span class="name">Virgo</span> is represented with wings. This change from the Golden Age to the Silver Age was
                  initiated by the overthrow of <span class="persName">Chronus</span> and the Titans by <span class="persName">Zeus</span> and his siblings, who introduced the seasons and consequently revolutions of scarcity
                  and conflict. <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> adds the alternative myth about the fall of the Golden Age associated with <span class="persName">Demeter</span> and the loss of her daughter, the virgin <span class="persName">Persephone</span>, to abduction by <span class="persName">Hades</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 180–81).</p> 
               <p>For <span class="persName">Green</span>, description of <span class="name">Virgo</span> touches off controversy over calculating the age of the world. Just as, in discussing
                  <a class="link_ref" href="#LEOGLOSS" title="the generous leo (MS IA RF T70 MS III)Leo (the Lion) like Scorpio (the Scorpion) is a constellation of the Zodiac but they are ...">Leo</a>, he rails against “antiquaries” who date relics of <span class="name">Zodiac</span> signs based on the precession of the equinoxes, arriving at conclusions that conflict
                  with the numbering of generations listed in the <span class="titlem">Bible</span>, so <span class="name">Virgo</span>ʼs ancient connection with the autumn equinox prompts his indignation with the “modern
                  philosopher” whose “speculations” lead to impiety: “We have mentioned that the sign
                  <span class="name">Leo</span> commences the <span class="name">zodiac</span> of <span class="placeName">Dendera</span>; but another zodiac has been discovered in <span class="placeName">Egypt</span> at <span class="placeName">Estné</span>, carved on a portico among the ruins at that place, commencing with the sign <span class="name">Virgo</span>; and from this circumstance it has been argued, that it must be at least two thousand
                  years older than the one at <span class="placeName">Dendera</span>. Some late discoveries respecting Egyptian writing, made by <span class="persName">M. Champollion</span>, have rendered it more than probable, that this ancient relic of astrology at <span class="placeName">Estné</span> was erected during the reign of the emperor <span class="persName">Claudius</span>, and that it could have preceded the one at <span class="placeName">Dendera</span> at most but by the duration of his reign, which continued only fourteen years. .
                  . . We should have passed this subject without notice, if the spirit of modern inquiry
                  did not strangely connect the speculations of science, and even those of fancy, with
                  the truths of revealed religion. The modern philosopher rejects as fabulous the chronology
                  of the <span class="titlem">Bible</span>, established on the uninterrupted evidence of a series of generations, and, by a
                  wonderful inconsistency and credulity, places implicit faith in the uncertain interpretation
                  of Egyptian signs and hieroglyphics, the date and the meaning of which are unknown”
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 80). <span class="persName">Green</span>ʼs objections, by exposing the supposed unscientific procedures of his adversaries,
                  reflect the influence of <span class="persName">Thomas Chalmers</span>ʼs approach to the “evidences” of <span class="orgName">Christianity</span> in relation to science (see <a class="link_ref" href="#LEOGLOSS" title="the generous leo (MS IA RF T70 MS III)Leo (the Lion) like Scorpio (the Scorpion) is a constellation of the Zodiac but they are ...">Leo</a>).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, for his part, appears to found no grounds for contradiction. If <span class="name">Virgo</span> once coincided with the vernal rather than autumnal equinox, “that <span class="name">zodiac</span> carries us back 90° on the Ecliptic, and its date must be fixed about 6450 years
                  ago. This deduction, according to the chronology of the Sacred Writings, carries us
                  back to the earliest ages of the human species on earth, and proves, at least, that
                  Astronomy was among the first studies of mankind. The most rational way of accounting
                  for this <span class="name">zodiac</span> seems to be, by assigning it to the family of <span class="persName">Noah</span>, or perhaps to the patriarch himself; in which case it may be considered as a monument
                  that perpetuates the actual state of the heavens immediately subsequent to the creation.
                  In short, if it be fact, as appears, that <span class="persName">Noah</span> himself travelled eastward after the deluge, and his whole life leads us to believe
                  he was versed in all the science of his time, he might also transmit to his posterity,
                  the zodiac of the antedeluvians, without the equator or ecliptic. But though <span class="geogName">Asia</span> might thus become the cradle of Astronomy, the stargazers of ancient <span class="placeName">Egypt</span> in process of time were, without doubt, instructed in the true system of the world;
                  and attributed the order which reigns in nature to the wisdom of a supreme and eternal
                  First Cause, though they publicly chimed in with die popular errors of the multitude”

By modern dating, the <span class="name">sun</span> enters <span class="name">Libra</span> on October 27, according to <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs reckoning in the <span class="date">1820s</span>; and as an inheritance of ancient reckoning, which associated <span class="name">Libra</span> with the autumnal equinox, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> adds, “we are accustomed to say that when the <span class="name">Sun</span> comes to <span class="name">Libra</span>, . . . the days and nights are then equal all over the earth”, appropriately to the
                  sign of the balance, “except at the poles; and that it is the beginning of day at
                  the South Pole, and the end of day at the North Pole” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 44).</p> 
               <p><span class="name">Libra</span> bore differing meaning and significance for the Greeks and for the Romans—a difference
                  reflected in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs first‐drafted and first fair‐copied lines versus his subsequently revised lines
                  on the constellation (see textual note). His initial idea, playing on a name for <span class="name">Libra</span> as “the scales” rather than “the balance”, relates to the Greek notion that the constellation
                  “perpetuate[d] the memory of <span class="persName">Mochus</span>, the inventor of weights and measures” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 44). In <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs figure, because the scales are aerial, they “nothing to weigh would bear”, and
                  “yet contain a thousand more” (stars, presumably), perhaps even “more than than the
                  milky way” contains.</p> 
               <p>In his revision, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> substitutes the Roman interpretation of the scales as a balance of justice, “in which
                  twas vainly said / The crimes and virtues of men were weighed”—“vainly”, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> presumably means, because pagan justice has been superceded by <span class="orgName">Christian</span> judgment. <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> explains why the representation of balanced justice made <span class="name">Libra</span> a “favoured constellation” for the Romans: “The <span class="name">Moon</span> was said to have been in <span class="name">Libra</span> when <span class="placeName">Rome</span> was founded”. Thus, according to the Roman writer <span class="persName">Manilius</span> in the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomica</span></span>, “What sign would better have the care of Italy . . . than that which controls all,
                  knows the weights of things, marks totals, and separates the unequal from the equal,
                  the sign in which the seasons are balanced and the hours of night and day match each
                  other?” For it is given to <span class="placeName">Italy</span> in turn to control all. <span class="placeName">Italy</span> “belongs to the Balance, her rightful sign: beneath it <span class="placeName">Rome</span> and her sovereignty of the world were founded. <span class="placeName">Rome</span>, which controls the issue of events, exalting and depressing nations placed in the
                  scales: beneath this sign was born the emperor, who has now effected a better foundation
                  of the city and governs a world which hangs on his command alone” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 116–17; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#MANILIUSASTRONOMICA"><span class="persName">Manilius</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomica</span></span></a>, 283, 285 [bk. 4, lines 769–77]).</p>

                  ramparts. They also settle on the yard‐arms and other parts of ships while sailing,
                  producing a kind of vocal sound, like that of birds flitting about. When they occur
                  singly they are mischievous, so as even to sink the vessels, and if they strike on
                  the lower part of the keel, setting them on fire. When there are two of them they
                  are considered auspicious, and are thought to predict a prosperous voyage. . . . On
                  this account their efficacy is ascribed to <span class="name">Castor</span> and <span class="name">Pollux</span>, and they are invoked as gods” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#PLINYNATURALISHISTORIA"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Natural History</span></span>, trans. <span class="persName">Bostock</span> and <span class="persName">Riley</span>, bk. 2, chap. 37</a>; see also <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 99).</p>

               <p>Ruskinʼs line bestows a poetic epithet on the sky rather than on the constellation,
                  which in his description suggests nothing more than a barnyard goat. <span class="name">Capricornus</span>, however, is a strange composite creature of goat and fish, a phenomenon that involves
                  <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> in discussion of the signʼs ancient history and etymology more than its legends,
                  which he calls “lame”. As if to draw attention away from the stories, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> seems reluctant in his plate to exhibit the strangeness of the creature, highlighting
                  realistically the goat that forms the upper half of the body, while only outlining
                  the fishtail that forms its lower half—the latter space dominated by the drawing of
                  <span class="name">Capricornusʼs</span> near neighbor, <span class="name">Aquarius</span> (plate 21) (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 46–47). In contrast, the artist who copied <span class="persName">Jamiesonʼs</span> depictions for <span class="name">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span>—the <span class="persName">Reverend Richard Rouse Bloxam</span> (1765–1840), possibly along with his spouse, <span class="persName">Ann</span> (1766–1835) (<span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, “<span class="name">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span>”)—exploited the amphibious weirdness of the creature by devoting a single card to
                  <span class="name">Capricornus</span>, without <span class="name">Aquarius</span> (card 25) and by coloring its tail a scaly blue‐green ending in a pink and yellow
                  fin.</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> may have averted to the immaterial “arched sky”, shying away from the Greek legends
                  about <span class="name">Capricornus</span>, if he knew them, which are mostly lascivious. <span class="name">Capricornus</span> is said to be <span class="persName">Pan</span>, whose adventures both <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> and <span class="persName">Green</span> confine to the origin story of his metamorphosis: “On a certain occasion”, as <span class="persName">Green</span> tells the story, “<span class="persName">Pan</span>, with some other deities, were feasting near the banks of the <span class="geogName">Nile</span>, when suddenly the giant <span class="persName">Typhon</span> appeared among them. This occasioned so much terror that they all changed themselves
                  into different forms and fled in every direction. <span class="persName">Pan</span>, who was the guardian of hunters and shepherds, plunged into the river; that part
                  of his body which was under the water assumed the form of a fish, and the other part
                  that of a goat. <span class="persName">Jupiter</span>, in order to preserve the memory of this event, placed this fantastic animal among
                  the stars” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 88).</p> 
               <p>Omitted are the stories and attributes favored by painters, such as the tale told

                  pass hither and, dwelling in a heaven that is their own, live the infinite years of
                  paradise and enjoy celestial bliss”. <span class="persName">Manilius</span> goes on to list many of those heroes and sages, ending in <span class="persName">Augustus</span>, who “has come down from heaven and heaven one day will occupy, guiding its passage
