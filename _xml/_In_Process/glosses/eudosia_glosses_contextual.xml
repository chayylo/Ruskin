                    1683. The rose is known by every body at first sight, and has been a favorite flower
                    from time immemorial among the civilized nations of Europe and Asia. The shrub
                    varies in size in different species , from one foot to six or eight, and the colors are red,
                    white, yellow, purple, black, striped; simple, or in almost numberless shades and mix-
                    tures; and single , semi-double, and double. It is cultivated in every garden, from that
                    of the most humble cottager upwards; some species as <hi rend="italic">R. centifolia damascena</hi>, &#x0026;c. are
                    also cultivated by commercial gardeners on a large scale for distilling rose-water, and for
                    making <hi rend="italic">attar</hi>, or essential oil of roses. Six pounds of rose leaves will impregnate by dis-
                    tillation a gallon of water strongly with their odour; but a hundred pounds afford
                    scarcely half an ounce of <hi rend="italic">attar</hi>. The rose is also used in medicine.
                    Botanists are not agreed as to the number of original species of this genus, some
                    regard all the European species as originated from one source; others, and especially
                    the moderns, divide them into species, sub-species, and varieties. The most scientific
                    work which has appeared on the roses in England, is the "<hi rend="italic">Rosarum Monographia</hi>"
                    of J. Lindley, 1819, in which above a hundred species or sub-species are described,
                    and some of them figured; and Miss Laurence has published ninety plates of "A
                    Collection of Roses from Nature," 1810. In France, Guillemeau has published "<hi rend="italic">His-
                    toire Naturelle de la Rose</hi>," 1800; and P. J. Redouté and C. A. Thory are engaged in
                    a splendid work, in folio, entitled "<hi rend="italic">Les Roses</hi>," containing plates of all the known species
                    and varieties of this flower. C. A. Thory has published a separate tract on their culture,
                    entitled "<hi rend="italic">Prodrome de la Monographie du Genre Rosier, &#x0026;c.</hi>" 1820; M. A. Pronville,
                    a "<hi rend="italic">Nomenclature Raisonée</hi>," in 1818; and J. P. Vibert, <hi rend="italic">Observations, &#x0026;c.</hi> in 1820.
                    A copious and intelligent account of the Scotch roses has been lately given by J. Sabine
                    (<hi rend="italic">Hort. Trans</hi>. iv. 231.), and some hundreds of new varieties have flowered from seedling
                    plants, in the nursery of J. Lee, during the present year, and will be found in his cata-
                    logue for 1822.
                    <hi rend="italic">Species and Varieties</hi>. The lists of the London and Paris nurserymen contain up-
                    wards of 350 names. The greater part of these have been raised from seed on the
                    continent, where it ripens better than in this country, within the last thirty years. A
                    number of varieties have also been raised in this country, especially of the <hi rend="italic">R. spinosissima</hi>,
                    or Scotch rose, of which twenty-six sorts are enumerated by J. Sabine, as having been
                    raised within the last twenty years. New varieties are raised in France and Italy
                    annually; L. Villaresi , royal gardener at Monza has raised upwards of fifty varieties
                    of <hi rend="italic">Rosa indica</hi>; not one of which have, as far as we know, reached this country. Some
                    of them are quite black, others shaped like a ranunculus, and many of them highly
                    odoriferous.

                    1635. Of this genus there are sixteen species introduced in Britain, and the whole of
                    them may be reckoned very choice flowers. We shall notice particularly, only those
                    species, of which numerous varieties have been produced. These are:
                    The <hi rend="italic">White Lily, L. Candidum</hi>  (<hi rend="italic">Bot. Mag.</hi> 278.), has a large scaly bulb, a
                    leafy stem, from three to four feet in height, terminating in large pure white
                    flowers on peduncles. It is a native of the Levant , and was in most gar-
                    dens in Gerarde’s time. Of this species, there are above eight varieties.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Orange Lily, L. bulbiferum</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Bot. May</hi>.[sic] 36), has a scaly bulb, a leafy
                    stem, two feet and a half high, terminating in orange-colored flowers.
                    Sometimes the stem produces small green bulbs in the axillae of the leaves. Of this species, there are eight or ten varieties and sub-varieties. 
                    The <hi rend="italic">Martagon</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Turk's Cap, L. Martagon</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">Bot. Mag</hi>. 893.), has a large 
                    scaly bulb, a stalk furnished with narrow leaves, near three feet high, and
                    terminating peduncles of fine carmine flowers in July. Of this species there
                    are half a dozen varieties, besides the scarlet martagon (<hi rend="italic">L. Chalcedonicum</hi>),
                    of which there are also different sorts. 
                    Besides the above species and their varieties, there are the <hi rend="italic">L. Canadense</hi>,
                    <hi rend="italic">superbum</hi>, or Turk's cap; the <hi rend="italic">Pomponium</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Tigrinum</hi>, or Tiger Lily; all
                    equally meriting cultivation as select flowers.

                    1640. The roots are tuberous and fasciculated; the stems rise from five to eight feet,
                    covered with large compound leaves, resembling those of the common dwarf elder, and 
                    with side branches bearing numerous flowers of a great variety of colors, which appear
                    in August, and continue till destroyed by frost. The plant grows wild in Mexico, in
                    sandy meadows, and was sent to Madrid in 1789, and thence to England in the same 
                    year; but the plants being lost, seeds were reintroduced by Lady Holland in 1804, and
                    from these and some plants imported from France during the peace of 1814, the present 
                    extensive stock of dahlias has originated. Till this last period they were much more 
                    cultivated in France and Germany than in England, and more especially by the Count 
                    Lebeur, at Paris, and M. Otto, at Berlin. At present the dahlia is the most fashion-
                    able flower in this country, and the extent of its culture in some of the nurseries, espe-
                    cially that of J. Lee, is truly astonishing. Nor is this to be wondered at, as Sabine
                    observes, for, independently of the great beauty and diversity of the flowers, they are in
                    perfection at a season when, till they came into notice, our gardens had but little orna-
                    ment. The roots are edible, but not agreeable.
                    <hi rend="italic">Varieties</hi>. The leading varieties of the fertile-rayed species <hi rend="italic">D. superflua</hi>, are,
                    the purple, rose, pale, white, sulphur, yellow, tawny, copper, brick red,
                    dark-red, pomegranate colored , dark purple, very dark, and lilac flowered 
                    single, semi-double, and double, with innumerable sub-varieties.
                    Of the barren.rayed species, <hi rend="italic">D. frustranea</hi>, there are the scarlet, bright-scarlet,
                    orange, saffron, and yellow flowered, single, semi-double, and double, with
                    several sub-varieties, though this species has not sported nearly so much as the other.
                    At the Hammersmith nursery, above 200 sorts may be procured.

                    with a singular smell like that of the anise. It is a native of most parts of Europe, in woods,
                    coppices, and sheltered lanes, particularly in a clayey soil. The flowers of the wild plant are
                    almost always of a brimstone color, but some-times of a purple hue; they appear in March and April.

                    1627. The bulb of this plant is tunicated, the leaves broad and green, from the centre of which
                    arises a scape, with a spike of flowers, pointing in all directions, and by which it
                    is known, at first sight , from <hi rend="italic">Hyacinthus nonscriptus</hi>, L.; (<hi rend="italic">Scilla nonscripta</hi>, W.) in
                    which the scape is drooping, and the flowers all turned to one side. It is a native of
                    the Levant, and abundant about Aleppo and Bagdat, where it flowers in February;
                    here it flowers in March and April. It was cultivated by Gerarde in 1596; but had,
                    doubtless, long before been improved by the Dutch, who have added greatly to the
                    strength and beauty of the plant, and produced almost innumerable varieties.
                    <hi rend="italic">Varieties</hi>. Gerarde mentions the single and double blue, the purple, and the white.
                    Parkinson, in 1629, enumerates eight sorts. Miller says, the Haerlem gardeners dis-
                    tinguish near 2000 sorts, and generally publish catalogues of them from year to year.
                    At present, the taste for this flower being considerably abated, the Dutch and English
                    catalogues contain only a few hundred sorts. Mason's Catalogue for 1820, contains
                    three hundred sorts with names. These names are quite arbitrary, being given by the
                    grower after himself or some public character; and therefore they are here omitted.
                    They are arranged as double-blues, whites, reds, and yellows, and single sorts of the
                    same colors; the blues and reds are the most numerous; the yellow, those of which there is least variety .
                    Only single hyacinths were, at first, cultivated; but about the beginning of the last
                    century, attention was paid to double-flowers by Peter Voerhelm, whose first double-
                    flower was named <hi rend="italic">Mary</hi>, and is now lost; but his third flower, <hi rend="italic">the King of Great Britain</hi>,
                    which is now looked upon as the oldest double-hyacinth, was greatly preferred to all the
                    flowers known, and the price of it was then above 1000 florins or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling. Up
                    to the middle of last century, the greatest attention was paid at Haerlem to raising new
                    sorts of double-flowers; and as much as 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been known to be given for a root;
                    but since that period, the taste for this and other bulbous flowers has considerably de-
                    clined, and at present there are few sorts for which more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. are asked,
                    the general price being from one to ten shillings a bulb for the varied sorts, and what
                    are called the common mixtures, are sold at from 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a hundred. A variety de-
                    generates, under bad treatment, in two or three years; but in Holland some have been preserved nearly a century.

                    1631. The bulb is round, solid and compressed with a netted skin, from the centre of 
                    which arise four or five grass-like leaves, and one or two flowers. Out of the centre of the
                    tube of the flower arises a slender style, crowned by a broad flat stigma of a gold color.

                    the tube, pushes out of the ground, and ripens its seeds; a singular economy in nature,
                    and which occurs only in the colchicum, and a few other plants.
                    All the known species of this genus may be considered as florists' flowers. Many
                    botanists, indeed, consider that there is only two species, the <hi rend="italic">C. vernus</hi>, or spring-blowing
                    crocus; and the <hi rend="italic">C. sativus</hi>, the saffron, or autumn crocus.
                    From the <hi rend="italic">Crocus vernus</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">Eng. Bot</hi>. 343 and our <hi rend="italic">fig</hi>. 440.) they consider that 
                    the <hi rend="italic">C. versicalor</hi> (<hi rend="italic">fig</hi>. 441.), the <hi rend="italic">C. biflorus</hi> (<hi rend="italic">fig</hi>. 442. <hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the <hi rend="italic">C. susiana</hi> (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the
                    <hi rend="italic">C. sulphureus</hi> (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>), and the <hi rend="italic">C. mæsianus</hi> (<hi rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e</hi>), with their numerous sub-
                    varieties, have been produced by cul-ture or locality.
                    From the <hi rend="italic">Crocus sativus</hi>, or saffron crocus (<hi rend="italic">Eng. Bot</hi>. 343. and our <hi rend="italic">fig</hi>. 443. <hi rend="italic">a</hi>),
                    they think it likely that the <hi rend="italic">C. serotinus</hi> (<hi rend="italic">fig</hi>. 443. <hi rend="italic">b</hi>), and the <hi rend="italic">C. nudiflorus</hi> (<hi rend="italic">fig</hi>. 443. <hi rend="italic">e</hi>),
                    have been also originated by cultivation or accident.
                    It is sufficient for our purpose to observe, that all the sorts have been time out of 
                    mind, and still are, great ornaments to the garden; the spring sorts coming into flower
                    in February and March, and the autumn sorts in September and October.
                    The color of the spring crocus in its wild state in Switzerland, is white with a pur-
                    ple base; it is considered as naturalized in England, but when found wild, is almost 
                    always of a yellow color. The autumn crocus, or saffron, is also found wild in some
                    places, and considered as naturalized; but it appears to be an African plant, and intro-
                    duced originally in Edward the Third's time, which its Arabic name, <hi rend="italic">sahafaran</hi>, seems
                    to justify. Its colour is generally purple or blue, as is that of most of the autumn va-
                    rieties in cultivation at present.
                    <hi rend="italic">Varieties</hi>. None of these are double. Of the spring crocus, Parkinson has enume-
                    rated twenty-seven varieties; the fundamental colours of which are blue, purple, yellow,
                    and white. Miller recites twelve as leading sorts. Mason's catalogue for 1820 men-
                    tions “twenty named sorts,” besides the light, dark, and striped purple, cloth of gold;
                    the Scotch crocus beautifully striped, the white, the large and small yellow, and several
                    striped sorts. The Dutch are continually producing new varieties, as are some florists
                    in this country, of which Haworth (<hi rend="italic">Hort</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Trans</hi>. i. 122.) may be cited as an instance.
                    Of the autumn crocus, Parkinson has enumerated four; and Ray, six varieties. Mil-
                    ler has only four: the sweet-smelling, of a deep blue; the mountain, of a paler blue;
                    the many-flowering, bluish; and the small flowering. Most of these varieties are now lost.

                    the flower-stems, which are from six to eighteen inches in height, bear either solitary or
                    fasciculated flowers; the color of the flower is either white or yellow, and generally
                    highly odoriferous. Most of the species are natives of the south of Europe, but one,
                    the <hi rend="italic">N. Pseudo-Narcissus</hi>, is a native of England, and common in woods in clayey soils.

                    1634. Of this genus there are three species which are considered as florists' flowers;
                    of these species there are numerous varieties.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Crown Imperial</hi>, <hi rend="italic">F. Imperialis</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Bot. Mag</hi>. 194.) <hi rend="italic">La Couronne Imperiale</hi>, Fr.;

                    from which arise strong stems, from two to four feet in height, furnished with
                    numerous broad shining green leaves, and crowned with a whirl of showy pendulous
                    flowers, yellow, red, or striped in various ways, which appear in March and April.
                    It is one of the earliest ornaments of the flower garden, producing a fine 
                    appearance in the middle of large borders , at a season when such flowers are most
                    wanted. The “singular nectary,” Professor Martyn observes, “cannot but engage 
                    the attention of the curious observer; it is a white glandular cavity, at the base
                    of each petal, and has a drop of limpid nectarious juice standing in it, when the
                    flower is in vigour. Another of the wonders of nature may be observed in the
                    peduncles which bend down while the plant is in flower, but become upright as the
                    seed ripens.” There are above a dozen varieties in cultivation, distinguished by
                    the different shades of yellow, white, and red in the flower, and by being striped double or semi-double.

                    1633. There are several species of this genus, which are considered florists' flowers.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Persian Iris</hi>, <hi rend="italic">I. Persica</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">Bot. Mag</hi>., and our <hi rend="italic">fig</hi>. 444. <hi rend="italic">a</hi>), a very low bulbous-
                    rooted plant, with delicate blue and violet-colored flowers, greatly esteemed
                    for their beauty and sweet smell, which is so powerful that one plant 
                    will scent a whole room. It is a native of Persia, and was cultivated by Parkinson
                    in 1629. The bulbs are generally imported from Holland, and blown in 
                    water-glasses, or pots of sand with very little earth intermixed, in February and March.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Snake's-head Iris</hi>, <hi rend="italic">I. tuberosa</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">Bot. Mag</hi>. 551. and <hi rend="italic">fig</hi>. 444. <hi rend="italic">b</hi>), has long 
                    narrow four-cornered leaves, and a dark purple flower, which appears in April.
                    It is a native of the Levant, and was cultivated in 1597. The tubers are generally imported from Holland. 
                    The <hi rend="italic">Chalcedonian Iris</hi>, <hi rend="italic">I. susiana</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">Bot. Mag</hi>. 91, and <hi rend="italic">fig</hi>. 444. <hi rend="italic">c</hi>), has finely
                    striated leaves, a scape a span high, and the largest and most magnificent 
                    corolla of all the species. Its petals are of a delicate texture, almost as
                    broad as a hand, purple or black striped with white. It flowers in the 
                    beginning of June; is a native of the Levant, and was cultivated by Gerarde in 1596.
                    The <hi rend="italic">bulbous-rooted</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Spanish Iris</hi>, <hi rend="italic">I. xiphium</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">Bot. Mag</hi>. 686, and <hi rend="italic">fig</hi>. 445. <hi rend="italic">a</hi>),
                    has channelled leaves, convoluted during their whole length, and awl-shaped
                    at the tip; the flowers of the wild plant are blue, with emarginate
                    petals, and appear in June; but cultivation has produced a great number
                    of varieties with yellow, white, violet, and variegated flowers. It is a native
                    of the south of Europe, and was cultivated by Gerarde in 1596. 
                    The <hi rend="italic">Great bulbous-rooted Iris</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">English Iris</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Dutch</hi>, <hi rend="italic">I. xiphioides</hi> 
                    (<hi rend="italic">Bot. Mag</hi>. 687, and <hi rend="italic">fig</hi>. 56. <hi rend="italic">b</hi>), is much larger than the other in all its parts,
                    the flower-stalk is near twice the height, and the flowers are more than
                    double the size. It is equally prolific in varieties as <hi rend="italic">Ixiphium</hi>, of which 
                    it is by some botanists considered only a variety. The tubers of both sorts are annually imported from Holland.

                    1711. This beautiful tribe comprehends numerous species and varieties of herbaceous
                    suffruticose and shrubby plants, generally of a somewhat succulent nature
                    throughout. They are almost all natives of the Cape of Good Hope, and with the
                    exception of three or four species, have been introduced, or originated here from
                    seed during the present and latter end of the last century. They are chiefly admired
                    for their flowers, which they produce in abundance from May to September,
                    generally in corymbs from the axillæ of the leaves of every shade of red, scarlet,
                    and purple, mixed with white and yellow. The plants are casily cultivated, and
                    by proper pruning, with the aid of gentle forcing in winter, many of the species, as the
                    <hi rend="italic">P. zonale, cuculatum, cordatum, &#x0026;c.</hi> may be kept in flower all the year. The best
                    collection of this family is in the nursery of Messrs. Colville, under the care of
                    R. Sweet, whose “<hi rend="italic">Geraniæ</hi>,” now publishing, is the most elegant and complete work of its kind.

                    Cape; but the greater number of the admired sorts have been raised in this country
                    from seed; some of these have received systematic appellations, but the greater number
                    have been named by those who raised them after themselves, or their friends, in the

                    1639. Most of the species of this plant introduced in this country may be considered
                    as select flowers; but that which has been longest cultivated is the <hi rend="italic">P. officinalis</hi>
                    (<hi rend="italic">Bot. Mag</hi>. 1784.) The roots are composed of roundish tubers, the stalks of the leaves rise
                    between two and three feet high, and terminate in large red or purple flowers, which
                    appear in May. The leaves are composed of many unequal lobes, variously cut into
                    many segments. It is a native of Switzerland, Dauphine, and other parts of Europe,
                    and also of China and Japan; and was cultivated here in 1562. The roots were formerly
                    much used in medicine.
                    <hi rend="italic">Varieties</hi>. Originally the common pæony was said to be of two sorts, male and
                    female, the flowers of the former being smaller and lighter colored than those of the
                    latter. These distinctions, which had no sexual allusion in this case, the pæony being
                    hermaphrodite, are now laid aside, and the varieties of <hi rend="italic">P. officinalis</hi> have been reduced
                    by J. Sabine (<hi rend="italic">Hort. Trans</hi>. ii. 273.) to the following:
                    The <hi rend="italic">double red</hi>, the most common, and formerly highly prized; being, when

                    The Common Oak, Q. robur, (Eng. Bot. 1845.) a native of Britain. It grows to
                    the height of fifty or sixty feet when in a heavy loam; flowers in April, and ripens its
                    acorns in October and November.
                    The most valuable variety of the common oak is said (Caled. Hort. Mem. iii. 376.)

                    distinct species. It is distinguished from Q. robur by the marked circumstance of the
                    acorns being placed on long fruit-stalks, whilst those of the robur are nearly sessile.
                    Besides, the superior utility and hardiness of the timber, the pedunculated oak is, in
                    fact, the most magnificent of the two British sorts. Miller says, this variety of the
                    Q. robur, (and which he calls the fæmina,) is more rare than the sessile-fruited; but
                    Professor Martyn says, this is not the case, and that the pedunculated is equally
                    general as the other. It is observed by Du Hamel, that oaks in forests being propagated
                    from the acorn, there are so many varieties that it is difficult to find two resembling
                    each other in every respect. Professor Martyn observes, that the figures in 
                    ancient authors have the fruit uniformly on foot-stalks, which shows that that variety
                    had been most common: and Ray considers it as the common oak of England. Du Roi
                    affirms, that the timber of the sessile-fruited is reddish, and brittle, whilst that
                    of the stalk-fruited is whitish and hard. From these, and various accounts, as well as our
                    own observation, we consider ourselves justified in recommending to nurserymen and
                    others, who gather acorns for seeds, to take effectual precautions that only the stalked sort be gathered.
                    1912. The Turkey Oak, Q. cerris, (Du Roi, 2 t. 5. f. 1.) a native of the south of
                    Europe, introduced in 1735. This species is distinguished by oblong, pointed, and
                    frequently lyrate leaves, jagged, and a little hoary on the under side. The acorns are
                    small, and have rough, prickly cups. The tree grows from forty to sixty feet high.
                    There are several varieties, but the best is that called the Devonshire or Luccombe,
                    from the name of the person who raised it from seeds, saved from a tree of the
                    Turkey-oak grown in Devonshire.
                    There are about forty species of exotic oaks introduced in this country, which may
                    be considered as timber trees, and are such in effect, in their native countries. Of
                    these, the greater part are natives of America; and it has been recommended,
                    (Caled. Mem. iii. 378.) to cultivate the Q. tinctoria or Quercitron on account of its
                    bark, which affords a valuable yellow die[sic. All these species, however, are either too
                    tender, or too scarce, or too dwarfish, and slow-growing, to warrant us in considering any
                    other than the common and Luccombe oaks, as fit for the purposes of profitable planting.

                    It is a native shrub, of great importance as a hedge plant, and is also frequently
                    introduced into narrow plantations as an undergrowth. It will not grow, however,
                    under the drip of trees, and therefore, in a profitable point of view, is only to be
                    considered as affording the impermiable, close, and durable, and easily raised fences,
                    called quickset hedges. The timber of such plants as grow singly, and attain a tolerable
                    size, is valued by the millwright and turner, and the roots by the cabinet-maker. It
                    is often spoiled, Sang observes, through inattention after cutting; if it be allowed to
                    lie in entire logs or trunks, it soon heats, and becomes quite brittle and worthless; it
                    therefore ought to be instantly cut up into planks, and laid to dry. The haws and
                    foliage afford excellent food for deer.

                    great size and age. Evelyn, and after him, Professor Martyn, have referred to a great
                    number of examples of notable trees of this species.
