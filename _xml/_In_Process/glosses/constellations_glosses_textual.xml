                    It is not certain the hand is Ruskin's and might be his father's. If the word was intended as a revision to the text, there is no variant in the MS III fair copy that is otherwise unaccounted for by a revision in RF T70 and that can be matched with this substitution. 
                    A guess is that the letters are <hi rend="italic">wile</hi>.</p></note>

                    form a double constellation, each with its own name but typically represented together, the poetic expression presented a challenge to Ruskin. 
                    In the MS IA draft, he wrote "serpent" twice and, baffled, deleted the second "serpent", only to write it again as "serpent bearer". 
                    In the first fair copy, RF T70, he inserted a prominently drawn comma between the adjacently repeated words, 
                    and he added an explantory footnote: "Note the serpent and serpent bearer are two different constellations". 
                    In the second fair copy, MS III, he abandoned the comma but retained the footnote, tagged with an asterisk at the end of the line.</p></note>

                    He fair-copied that revised line in RF T70, but scored through "pretty" with pencil and wrote a substitution in the margin, also in pencil: 
                    "long billed"--the revision carried to MS III.</p></note>
                
                <note xml:id="DOWNTEXTGLOSS" resp="#DCH"><p><hi rend="bold">&#x201C;down below&#x201C;
                    (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>; <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>)&#x2014;</hi>In draft (MS IA) of lines 41-42, 
                    "antinous and arrow soon / after it the southern crown"; in first fair copy (RF T70), "soon" deleted and "down" substituted in the margin, 
                    and "After it" deleted and "much below [with e overwritten on l]" substituted in margin, and then "far" substituted for "much"; 
                    in second fair copy (MS III), the latter substitutions carried over as "down / far below".</p>
                   
                    <p>The adjacent adverbs at the end of line 41 and the beginning of line 42 are problematic, whether read as end-stopped or as enjambed. 
                        End-stop is the norm throughout this poem; and in RF T70, the placement of Ruskin's substitutions for, respectively, "soon" and "After it" can be viewed 
                        as two separate actions and not a single connected revision resulting in the elided "down far below". 
                        Considered as end-stopped lines, the revision of "after it" seems motivated by the disagreement of case 
                        between <hi rend="italic">it</hi> and the plural referent, the two constellations Antinous and Arrow. 
                        In this scenario, however, the substitution of "down" for "soon" is a perplexing choice, as the adverb appears to make no sense. 
                        The line might be read as meaning that Antinous and Arrow are "down" from Grus (the Crane) in the line above, 
                        which is factually incorrect--Antinous and Arrow are northern constellations, not "down" from the southern constellation Grus--but 
                        but this would not be the first time the poem contradicts the map of the sky.</p>
                    
                    <p>Alternatively, one might speculate that the substitution of "down" for "soon" was occasioned by the substitution of "far below" for after it", 
                        creating the enjambed "down far below" as a single adverbial modifier. If the adverb phrase applies to Antinuous and Arrow, 
                        however, the lines are made factually incorrect, since these constellations lie in the northern hemisphere--far above, 
                        not below, <ref type="internal" target="#CORONAAUSTRALISGLOSS">"the southern crown"</ref> in line 42. If applied to the latter, 
                        the enjambed phrase correctly describes the position of Corona Australis (the Southern Crown) but leaves Antinuous and Arrow without any modifier at all, 
                        adverbial or adjectival. Ruskin may have enjoyed the ambiguity of "down" being pulled two ways--if end-stoped, 
                        toward Antinous and Arrow, although the adverb makes no sense for those constellations; or if enjambed, 
                        toward Corona Australis, although the defection of the adverb leaves those constellations stranded.</p></note>
