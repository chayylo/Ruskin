                        a companion of the huntress, Artemis [Diana], is raped by Zeus [Jupiter]. Unable to conceal her pregnancy, Callisto is shunned by Artemis's chaste band, 
                        and she becomes prey to the revenge of Hera [Juno]. She is saved by metamorphosis into a bear, only to be hunted by Artemis as well as by Callisto's own unwitting son by Zeus, Arcas. 
                        Zeus rescues Callisto from this predicament by setting her in heaven as a constellation 
                        (Ridpath, Star Tales, 172-74, and see 174-75 for other stories; see also Ursa Minor, below).</p></note>

                    and made of it this constellation, as a reward for its faithful services. It has since become an emblem of vigilance. 
                    Others maintain, that in a war with the Giants, this Dragon was brought into the combat, 
                    and opposed to Minerva [Athena], who threw it round the axis of the earth before it had time to uncoil, where it remains to this day"

                    Eratosthanes and Ptolomy represented the asterism as the hair of famous women, but counted its stars among the constellation Leo (the Lion), 
                    and it was not treated as a separate constellation until the sixteenth century (Ridpath, Star Tales, 78).</p>
                    
                    <p>Green describes "[t]his remarkable cluster of minute stars" as "shine[ing] with a light somewhat like that of the Milky Way"; 
                    and he goes on to relay the story as told by the Latin writer, Hyginus, about a historical, third-century B.C. Egyptian woman, 
                    Berenice. She was "married her own brother, Evergestes, one of the kings of Egypt, whom she loved with much tenderness. 
                    Upon an important occasion, having left her to engage in a dangerous enterprise, she vowed to dedicate to Venus [Aphrodite] her hair, 
                    which was extremely beautiful, if he should be restored to her in safety. Some time after his victorious return, 
                    the locks which had been deposited in the temple of Venus, according to her oath, disappeared. The king expressing great regret for their loss, 
                    Connon, his astronomer, publicly reported that Jupiter [Zeus] had taken them away and placed them among the stars. 
                    Being sent for by Evergestes, Connon pointed out this constellation, saying, 
                    'There, behold the locks of the queen'. As this group was not before on the maps, 
                    being among the unformed stars until that time, this satisfied the king of the truth of Connon's declaration"

                    Theseus, king of Athens, was shut up in the celebrated labyrinth of Crete, erected by Daedalus,

                    made his escape from the intricate windings of his place of confinement. He afterwards married Ariadne, but soon treated her in the most cruel manner, 
                    so that she was induced, according to some writers, to commit suicide. After her death the crown of stars given by Bacchus was made this constellation"

              Theseus's mistreatment consisted in abandoning her on the island of Naxos. According to other versions of the story, Bacchus rescues and marries her

                    <p>Prior to the invention of the constellation, its prominent star was named Cor Caroli Regis Martyris 
                        "in honour of Charles I" by "Sir Charles Scarborough [1615-94], physician to Charles II"

                        A legend held that the star blazed brightly on the day in May 1660 when Charles II rode into London to restore the Stuart monarchy. 
                        Early in the nineteenth century, a German astronomer, Johann Bode (1747-1826), misattributed the naming of the star to the English astronomer, 
                        Edmond Halley (1656-1742), and moved its invention forward into the eighteenth century; independently, 
                        another error identified the star's namesake as Charles II. The star's proper origin, however, lies in the seventeenth century 
                        with those who regarded Charles I as a martyr (Warner, letter to the editor; 
                        Ridpath, Star Tales, 60). See also Charles's Oak, below, which Halley did name after Charles II.</p></note>

                    Hungarian astronomer, Maximilian Hell (1720-92), who devised it from "a few of the stars of Auriga [the Charioteer]. . . . 
                    It is intended to perpetuate the name of Herschell [William Herschel, 1738-1822] and the form of the instrument by which he discovered the planet Uranus in the year 1781"

                    Vulpecula et Anser "crosses the Milky Way a littie to the south of Cygnus,

                    <p>Vulcepula et Anser was introduced by the Polish astronomer, Johannes Hevelius (1611-87), 
                        who depicted it as a fox with a goose captured in its jaws. The haplessness of the bird may account for Ruskin's epithet of "stupid", 
                        but by dividing the constellation in two Ruskin also avoids drawing attention to the goose's fate. 
                        A precedent for separating the fox from the goose extends back to Hevelius himself, 
                        who named the constellation both as a single entity, Vulpecula <hi rend="italic">cum</hi>Anser, 
                        and as two distinct entities, which were afterward sometimes reunited as Vulpecula <hi rend="italic">et</hi> Anser. 
                        Nowadays, the goose is omitted altogether, leaving only Vulpecula (Ridpath, Star Tales, 182-83).</p>
                    
                    <p>Perhaps a predatory and carnivorous fox offended nineteenth-century sensibility, 
                        since Green omits any mention of what is happening to the goose, Ruskin not only separates the constellations, 
                        but also places Lepus (the Hare) between them. If he intended to shield the goose from the fox, 
                        he undercut the effort by giving the hare the epithet "timid".</p></note>

                        Ridpath adds that some mythographers viewed the nearby dog constellations, Canis Major and Canis Minor, as helping in Orion's chase of the hare. 
                        The stories that Ridpath summarizes about the hare suggest that it was read less with mythological associations than with moral and animal tales

                    The stars were known to Ptolemy, but he considered them as part of Centaurus in his catalogue of forty-eight constellations. 
                    As Ridpath explains, although visible to the ancient Mediterranean world, the stars were lost to view in the north owing to precession in the Earth's rotational axis. 
                    The stars were rediscovered and charted by European explorers sailing south in the sixteenth century, and it came to be used by navigators since its axis points to the southern pole

                    The constellation is now obsolete. According to Ridpath, its obsolescence was caused by the star survey undertaken from the Cape of Good Hope by the French astronomer, 
                    Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille (1713-62). The catalogue was published in 1763, but Johann Bode retained it in 1801 (Ridpath, Star Tales, 202-3).</p>
                    
                    <p>Charles's Oak was also treated as an existing constellation by <persName corresp="#JGREEN">Green</persName> in 1824: "Rober Caroli, or Charles's Oak, 
                        is to the east of Argo Navis, and contains one star of the first magnitude. Dr. [Edmond] Halley introduced this asterism on the maps 
                        in 1676, when he was in the Island of St. Helena. He named it in honour of the oak whose branches concealed Charles II 
                        after the battle of Worcester"

                        This battle represented the decisive defeat of Royalist forces in the English Civil War, during which the son of the executed king, Charles I, 
                        saved his life by hiding in an oak tree. After Charles II was restored to the throne, the purpose of his astronomer, Halley, 
                        in traveling to St. Helena was, like Lacaille's mission, to survey the southern sky, and he published his star catalogue, including the new honorific constellation, in 1679 (Ridpath, 202).</p></note>
