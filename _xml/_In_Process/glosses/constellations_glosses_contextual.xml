                        which is a small formation in the southern hemisphere, and which remains an officially recognized constellation today. 
                        It was created by the French astronomer, <persName corresp="#NLL">Nicolas&#x2010;Louis de Lacaille</persName> (<date notBefore="1713" notAfter="1762">1713&#x2013;62</date>); 
                        and while there is no way to prove <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s intent, it is reasonable to assume that he meant to celebrate the constellation honoring the British astronomer

                        who depicted it as a fox with a goose captured in its jaws. The haplessness of the bird may account for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s epithet of &#x201C;stupid&#x201D;,
                        but by dividing the constellation in two <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> also avoids drawing attention to the goose&#x02BC;s fate.
                        A precedent for separating the fox from the goose extends back to <persName corresp="#JHEVELIUS">Hevelius</persName> himself,
                        who named the constellation both as a single entity, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VULPECULAETANSER">Vulpecula <hi rend="italic">cum</hi> Anser</name>,

                    <p>Perhaps a predatory and carnivorous fox offended nineteenth&#x2010;century sensibility,

                        <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>&#x02BC;s claim to originality was evidently exaggerated, since, according to <persName corresp="#IRIDPATH">Ridpath</persName>, in <date when="1721">1721</date> an English cartographer, <persName corresp="#JSENEX">John Senex</persName> (<date notBefore="1678" notAfter="1740">1678&#x2013;1740</date>), 
                        combined the branch of golden apples with the three&#x2010;headed serpent to form the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CERBERUSETRAMUS">Cerberus et Ramus</name>, 
                        which then appeared in Heracles&#x02BC;s hand in <persName corresp="#JBODE">Johann Bode</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#URANOGRAPHIA"><hi rend="italic">Uranographia</hi></title> (<date when="1801">1801</date>)

                        The latter appears to be the source of <persName corresp="#JGREEN">Green</persName>&#x02BC;s rendering, which lacks <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>&#x02BC;s addition of the archery gear.</p>
                    
                    <p><persName corresp="#JGREEN">Green</persName> unpacks this representation with an ethical interpretation
                        of the hero &#x201C;celebrated in antiquity for his heroic valour and corporal strength. He is represented in a kneeling posture,
                        holding in his right hand a club, and in his left the Hesperidian branch, with the three&#x2010;headed <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CERBERUSCONSTELLATION">Cerberus</name>;
                        the skin of a lion covers his head and shoulders. This is the lion he killed in the forests in the neighbourhood of <placeName corresp="#NEMEA">Nem&#x00C6;a</placeName>,
                        and the celebrated Nem&#x00C6;an games were instituted to commemorate that event. [The astronomer] <persName corresp="#JHEVELIUS">Hevelius</persName> first placed in the hand of this hero the serpent
                        with three heads, or <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CERBERUSCONSTELLATION">Cerberus</name>. The Hesperidian branch, bearing the golden apples, is probably of a more ancient date. . . .
                        <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HERCULES">Hercules</persName>, among many other achievements, . . . procured some of these golden apples from the <placeName type="fictional" corresp="#HESPERIDES">Hesperides</placeName>,
                        by killing the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#DRACO">Dragon [Draco]</name>. . . . [i]t is stated by the mythologists, that he brought upon <name type="astronomical" corresp="#EARTH">earth</name> the three&#x2010;headed monster <name type="animal" corresp="#CERBERUS">Cerberus</name>,
                        which guarded the entrance to <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PLUTO">Pluto</persName>&#x02BC;s dominions. The victory which he obtained over <name type="animal" corresp="#CERBERUS">Cerberus</name>, is thought by some to denote his control
                        over his bad passions; for he is held out by the ancients as a pattern of virtue and piety. His judicious choice of virtue,
                        in preference to pleasure, is admirably described by <persName corresp="#XENOPHON">Xenophon</persName>&#x201D;
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><title type="book" corresp="#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><hi rend="italic">Astronomical Recreations</hi></title></ref>, 46&#x2013;47).</p>
                    
                    <p><persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName> proposes a more complex allegory, which he integrates with the constellation&#x02BC;s astronomical season: 
                        &#x201C;The Three Headed <name type="animal" corresp="#CERBERUS">Cerberus</name>, like the triform <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HECATE">Hecate</persName>, 
                        was a lunar symbol, and <name type="animal" corresp="#CERBERUS">Cerberus</name> brought back to the day by <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HERCULES">Hercules</persName>, in his 12th labour, 
                        appears to some, as an astronomical fable, relating to the arrival of the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#SUN">Sun</name> in <name type="astronomical" corresp="#SCORPIO">Scorpius</name>, or <hi rend="italic">Lesha</hi>, at the autumnal equinox. 
                        Thus <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HERCULES">Hercules</persName> is rendered partly an historical and partly an allegorical personage; and this combination is obviously the basis of the ingenious and elegant mythology of the Greeks. . . . 
                        If <name type="animal" corresp="#CERBERUS">Cerberus</name> be considered allegorically as the symbol of the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#EARTH">earth</name>, or more properly of all&#x2010;devouring time, 
                        his three months will represent the present, past, and future. The victory which <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HERCULES">Hercules</persName> obtained over this monster is thought to denote the conquest this hero acquired over his passions&#x201D;

                        was one among twelve southern constellations introduced to European sky charts in the <date notBefore="1567" notAfter="1599">late sixteenth century</date>, 
                        based on observations of the sky south of the equator the Dutch navigators, 
                        <persName corresp="#PDK">Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser</persName> and <persName corresp="#FdeH">Frederick de Houtman</persName>. 
                        The name <name type="astronomical" corresp="#APUS"><hi rend="italic">Apus</hi></name> was derived 
                        from the Greek for <hi rend="italic">without foot</hi>, since, as <persName corresp="#IRIDPATH">Ridpath</persName> explains, 
                        specimens originally obtained from <placeName corresp="#NEWGUINEA">New Guinea</placeName> by Europeans were skins from which the birds&#x02BC; feet had been removed, 
                        leading to speculation that these fabulous birds, with their long and colorful plummage, remained permanently in flight 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><persName corresp="#IRIDPATH">Ridpath</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><hi rend="italic">Star Tales</hi></title></ref>, 41).</p>
                    
                    <p>According to <persName corresp="#RHA">Richard Hinckley Allen</persName>, the constellation may have acquired the name, the Swallow, 
                        by way of the common English name for <persName corresp="#CLINNAEUS">Linnaeus</persName>&#x02BC;s species name, <hi rend="italic">Hirundo apus</hi>, 
                        which is also applied to the swift&#x2010;birds associated with the approach of summer

It is not clear, however, that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> identified the Swallow or Hirundo with the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#APUS">Apus</name> at all. 
                        These two constellations are listed separately in <title type="book" corresp="#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><hi rend="italic">An Introduction to Astronomy Intended for Little Children</hi> (<date when="1817">1817</date>)</title> by <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName> (<date notBefore="1775" notAfter="1851">1775&#x2013;1851</date>).

                    <p>As <persName corresp="#JRTOPHAM">Jonathan R. Topham</persName> has carefully argued, however, evangelicals such as <persName corresp="#TCHALMERS">Chalmers</persName> were not typically receptive to the optimistic version of natural theology 
                        that <persName corresp="#WPALEY">William Paley (<date notBefore="1743" notAfter="1805">1743&#x2013;1805</date>)</persName> influentially presented, with its evidences of a benevolent <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#CREATOR">Creator</persName> as watchmaker, yet many evangelicals&#x2014;especially Scottish evangelicals&#x2014;remained open to a &#x201C;theology of nature&#x201D;, 
                        which advocated &#x201C;a rational religion that would attract the cultured middle classes, while maintaining a scriptural and soteriological emphasis distinct from the largely ethical emphasis&#x201D; of natural theology. 
                        <persName corresp="#TCHALMERS">Chalmers</persName> arrived at this approach following a transformative conversion experience, resulting in an essay widely disseminated in <date when="1814">1814</date> as

                        Written after he underwent an evangelical conversion, <persName corresp="#TCHALMERS">Chalmers</persName>&#x02BC;s approach to evidences of the truth of <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christianity</orgName>, 
                        In it, <persName corresp="#TCHALMERS">Chalmers</persName> pursues an &#x201C;inductive Baconian &#x201C;science of theology . . . based strictly on historical evidence. 
                        This comprised chiefly the &#x2018;external evidence&#x2019; of the truth of the Christian revelation (the miracles and prophecies attending it), 
                        but also included . . . the &#x2018;internal evidence&#x2019;, namely the &#x2018;marks of truth&#x2019; in the <title type="scripture" corresp="#NEWTESTAMENT">New Testament</title> considered as a human composition, 
                        and the evidence provided by the text as to the character of its authors. These inferences were sound, he argued, since they were based on observations of human nature, of which people have much empirical experience&#x201D;. 
                        By comparison, <persName corresp="#TCHALMERS">Chalmers</persName> considered a Paleyan natural theology that judged &#x201C;the truth of <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christianity</orgName> on the reasonableness of its doctrines, 
                        or any supposed agreement between the nature of the Christian religion and the character of the supreme being&#x201D; to be reliant

                    one in the southern hemisphere and one in the north. The earlier claim belonged to the southern constellation, situated immediately south of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CRUX">Crux (the Southern Cross)</name>,
                    and included among the twelve constellations that <persName corresp="#PPLANCIUS">Plancius</persName> devised in <date when="1598">1598</date>, based on observations by his fellow Dutchmen, 
                    <persName corresp="#PDK">Keyser</persName> and <persName corresp="#FdeH">de Houtman</persName> during their exploration of the Indies. 
                    Initially, <persName corresp="#PPLANCIUS">Plancius</persName> left the constellation unnamed&#x2014;elsewhere, it was called by the Dutch word for <hi rend="italic">fly</hi>, De Vlieghe&#x2014;and then in <date when="1612">1612</date>, 
                    <persName corresp="#PPLANCIUS">Plancius</persName> called it by the Greek word for <hi rend="italic">fly</hi>, Muia. Meanwhile, <persName corresp="#JBAYER">Johannes Bayer</persName> added to the confusion 
                    by labeling the constellation as <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MUSCAAUSTRALIS">Apis (the Bee)</name> in his <title type="book" corresp="#BAYERURANOMETRIA"><hi rend="italic">Uranometria</hi></title> (<date when="1603">1603</date>), mistaking the representation of the insect.

                    <p>The <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MUSCABOREALIS">northern Musca</name>&#x2014;which once buzzed above the back of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ARIES">Aries</name>, but is now obsolete as a constellation&#x2014;was likewise originally 
                    the creation of <persName corresp="#PPLANCIUS">Plancius</persName> in <date when="1612">1612</date>, but he called it the Bee.

                    <persName corresp="#JHEVELIUS">Hevelius</persName> renamed it <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MUSCA">Musca</name>. <persName corresp="#IRIDPATH">Ridpath</persName> shows this name used for the northern insect&#x2010;constellation in <persName corresp="#JBODE">Bode</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1801">1801</date> atlas&#x2014;naturally so, 
                    since <persName corresp="#JBODE">Bode</persName> reserved <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MUSCABOREALIS">Apis</name> for the name of the southern counterpart

                    <p>The details of this confusion matter since they may be helpful in identifying <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s source. His poem identifies <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MUSCABOREALIS">&#x201C;the little fly&#x201D;</name> 
                        at line 34 and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MUSCAAUSTRALIS">&#x201C;the armed bee&#x201D;</name> at line 48. Presumably, therefore, his source named two constellations, one named <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MUSCAAUSTRALIS">Musca, or the Fly</name> and the other <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MUSCAAUSTRALIS">Apis, or the Bee</name>, 
                        a combination suggesting <persName corresp="#JBODE">Bode</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#BODEURANOGRAPHIA"><hi rend="italic">Uranographia</hi></title> or a derivative. <persName corresp="#JBODE">Bode</persName>&#x02BC;s atlas or a related source would place <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MUSCA">Musca, or the Fly</name> in the northern hemisphere, within the border of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ARIES">Aries</name>. 
                        A northern identification cannot be confirmed in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem with certainty, given his caveat noted in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, 
                    &#x201C;[t]hese constellations though they are next in this poetry are not next in the sky&#x201D;. In the poem, the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MUSCABOREALIS">Fly</name> is said to be 
                        &#x201C;next to&#x201D; <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CAMELOPARDALIS">Camelopardalis</name>, which is named in line 33, and the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MUSCABOREALIS">Fly</name> is followed by the lines on

While <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MUSCABOREALIS">Musca</name> is not directly &#x201C;next to&#x201D; <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CAMELOPARDALIS">Camelopardalis</name> or <name type="astronomical" corresp="#OPHIUCHUS">Ophiuchus</name> in the sky or in any star atlas, 
                        the northern hemisphere is strongly suggested, and the nearly adjacent mention of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ARIES">Aries</name> seems to clinch the identification of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s Fly with <persName corresp="#JBODE">Bode</persName>&#x02BC;s northern <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MUSCABOREALIS">Musca</name>.</p>

                    which shows the map of the entire southern celestial hemisphere. The figure is not labeled in the plate; and since <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MUSCAAUSTRALIS">Apis</name> is excluded altogether 
                    from the plates showing close&#x2010;up sectors of the southern hemisphere, it goes unacknowledged in <title type="toy" corresp="#URANIASMIRROR">Urania&#x02BC;s Mirror</title>.

                    as well on account of the natural qualities of this most extraordinary insect, 
                    as on account of its being the old hieroglyphic of royalty. Of the insentient part of animated nature, 
                    the Bee is prince and chief for foresight, ingenuity, industry, and fidelity: it was thence the fittest symbol of a good king&#x201D;

                    &#x201C;<name type="astronomical" corresp="#ARIES">Aries</name> is the first of the old <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ZODIAC">zodiacal</name> constellations. About four thousand 
                    years ago, the vernal equinoctial point entered this sign; but from its apparent 
                    motion towards the west, owing to the precession of the equinoxes, it [the vernal equinox] is now 
                    found in the sign <name type="astronomical" corresp="#PISCES">Pisces</name>, within which it has remained about 2000 years&#x201D;. 
                    According to <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName> writing in <date when="1822">1822</date>, the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#SUN">sun</name> then entered <name type="astronomical" corresp="#PISCES">Pisces</name> on about <date when="1822-03-06">6 March</date> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ARIES">Aries</name> on about <date when="1822-04-22">22 April</date>. 
                    Thus, the vernal equinox, which falls on 20&#x2013;21 March, occurs when the ecliptic appears oriented toward <name type="astronomical" corresp="#PISCES">Pisces</name>

                        The North Pole is just coming into the light, and the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#SUN">Sun</name> is vertical to the Equator, which,

                        As <persName corresp="#IRIDPATH">Ridpath</persName> goes on to explain, thanks to <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MYRTILUS">Myrtilus</persName>&#x02BC;s horse training, 
                        his king was able to fend off suitors to his beautiful daughter, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HIPPODAMIA">Hippodamia</persName>, 
                        by challenging them to a race in which the penalty was death. After a dozen challengers had met their death, another suitor won <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HIPPODAMIA">Hippodamia</persName>&#x02BC;s love, 
                        leading her to persuade <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MYRTILUS">Myrtilus</persName> to tamper with the king&#x02BC;s chariot. <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MYRTILUS">Myrtilus</persName> agreed since he was in love with the girl himself, 
                        and so the king was killed in the race instead of the suitor. For his pains, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MYRTILUS">Myrtilus</persName> was murdered by the jealous suitor, 
                        explaining his sad lack of a chariot in the sky. (To this tale, <persName corresp="#IRIDPATH">Ridpath</persName> adds a third, mentioned by neither <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName> nor <persName corresp="#JGREEN">Green</persName>;

                    This story was drawn from <persName corresp="#ERATOSTHENES">Eratosthenes</persName>, who sets these events following

                    <p><persName corresp="#JGREEN">Green</persName> links the constellation to a story about another dolphin,&#x201C;&#x201C;which saved the life of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#ARION">Arion</persName>, 
                        the famous lyric poet and musician of <placeName corresp="#LESBOS">Lesbos</placeName>. . . . <persName type="fictional" corresp="#ARION">Arion</persName>, who had obtained

                        wealth to his native country. The sailors of the ship in which he had embarked, 
                        determined to murder him to obtain his riches. Aware of their infamous designs, 
                        he begged to be permitted before his death to play some melodious tunes, 
                        which as soon as he had finished he threw himself into the sea. 
                        A number of Dolphins had been attracted round the ship by the sweetness of the music, 
                        and it is said that one of them supported <persName type="fictional" corresp="#ARION">Arion</persName> on his back, and brought him safe to land.

                    <p>From the time of <persName corresp="#PTOLOMY">Ptolomy</persName>, the altar was imagined with its base oriented to the north and with flames rising from its top, oriented to the southern pole, 
                        and those visual elements were carried into modern representations

                        It seems not just the depiction of flames, however, that moved <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>,

                        his phrase suggests that he was forestalling association with the pagan rites involved in the myths originally connected with the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ARA">Altar</name>. 
                        The phrase &#x201C;god&#x02BC;s fire&#x201D; imposes a <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christian</orgName> typology on the altar flames, referring, e.g., to <title type="scripture" corresp="#LEV6_12-13">Leviticus 6:12&#x2013;13</title>:

                        The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar: it shall never go out&#x201D;. In a commentary on the passage in his popular annotated <title type="scripture" corresp="#SCOTTBIBLE">Bible</title>,

                    <!-- Ovid in his Fasti asserts that the name comes from the old
                    Greek word hyein, meaning ‘to rain’, so that Hyades means ‘rainy ones’, because
                    their rising at certain times of year was said to be a sign of rain. In mythology
                    the Hyades were the daughters of Atlas and Aethra the Oceanid. Their eldest
                    brother was Hyas, a bold hunter who one day was killed by a lioness. His sisters
                    wept inconsolably – Hyginus says they died of grief – and for this they were
                    placed in the sky. Hence it seems equally likely that their name comes from their
                    brother Hyas. In another story, the Hyades were nymphs who nursed the infant
                    Dionysus in their cave on Mount Nysa, feeding him on milk and honey. The
                    Romans had a different name: they called the Hyades suculae meaning ‘piglets’.
                    The mythographers were massively confused about the names and even the
                    number of the Hyades. They are variously described as being five or seven in
                    number. Ptolemy listed five Hyades in his star catalogue. Hyginus alone gives
                    four different lists of their names, none of which agrees completely with the list
                    of five given originally by Hesiod, namely Phaesyle, Coronis, Cleia, Phaeo, and
                    Eudore. Astronomers have avoided the problem by not naming any of the stars
                    of the Hyades.
                    The Hyades is a genuine cluster of stars lying about 150 light years away.
                    Binoculars and small telescopes show many more members of the Hyades than
                    are visible to the naked eye. In all, the cluster is estimated to contain several
                    hundred stars.
                    The Pleiades – seven celestial sisters
                    Even more famous than the Hyades is another star cluster in Taurus: the
                    Pleiades (Πλειάδες in Greek), commonly known as the Seven Sisters. To a
                    casual glance, the Pleiades cluster appears as a fuzzy patch like a swarm of flies
                    over the back of the bull. According to Hyginus, some ancient astronomers
                    called them the bull’s tail. So distinctive are the Pleiades that the ancient Greeks
                    regarded them as a separate mini-constellation and used them as a calendar marker. Hesiod, in his agricultural poem Works and Days, instructs farmers to
                    begin harvesting when the Pleiades rise at dawn, which in Greek times would
                    have been in May, and to plough when they set at dawn, which would have been
                    in November. Ptolemy did not list individual members of the Pleiades in his
                    Almagest, giving only an indication of the cluster’s size.
                    In mythology the Pleiades were the seven daughters of Atlas and the oceanid
                    Pleione, after whom they are named. One popular derivation is that the name
                    comes from the Greek word plein, meaning ‘to sail’ – so Pleione means ‘sailing
                    queen’ and the Pleiades are the ‘sailing ones’, because in Greek times they were
                    visible all night during the summer sailing season. When the Pleiades vanished
                    from the night sky, it was considered prudent to remain ashore. ‘Gales of all
                    winds rage when the Pleiades, pursued by violent Orion, plunge into the
                    clouded sea’, wrote Hesiod.
                    Alternatively, and possibly more likely, the name may come from the old
                    Greek word pleos, ‘full’, which in the plural meant ‘many’, a suitable reference to the cluster. According to other authorities, the name comes from the Greek
                    word peleiades, meaning ‘flock of doves’.
                    Unlike their half-sisters the Hyades, the names of all seven Pleiades are
                    assigned to stars in the cluster: Alcyone, Asterope, Celaeno, Electra, Maia,
                    Merope, and Taygeta. Two more stars are named after their parents, Atlas and
                    Pleione. Alcyone is the brightest star in the cluster. According to mythology,
                    Alcyone and Celaeno were both seduced by Poseidon. Maia, the eldest and most
                    beautiful of the sisters, was seduced by Zeus and gave birth to Hermes; she later
                    became foster-mother to Arcas, son of Zeus and Callisto. Zeus also seduced two
                    others of the Pleiades: Electra, who gave birth to Dardanus, the founder of
                    Troy; and Taygeta, who gave birth to Lacedaemon, founder of Sparta. Asterope
                    was ravished by Ares and became mother of Oenomaus, king of Pisa, near
                    Olympia, who features in the legend of Auriga. Hence six Pleiades became
                    paramours of the gods. Only Merope married a mortal, Sisyphus, a notorious
                    trickster who was subsequently condemned to roll a stone eternally up a hill.
                    Although the Pleiades are popularly termed the Seven Sisters, only six stars
                    are easily visible to the naked eye, and a considerable mythology has grown up
                    to account for the ‘missing’ Pleiad. Eratosthenes says that Merope was the faint
                    Pleiad because she was the only one who married a mortal. Hyginus and Ovid
                    also recount this story, giving her shame as the reason for her faintness, but both
                    add another candidate: Electra, who could not bear to see the fall of Troy, which
                    had been founded by her son Dardanus. Hyginus says that, moved by grief,
                    she left the Pleiades altogether, but Ovid says that she merely covered her eyes
                    with her hand. Astronomers, however, have not followed either legend in their
                    naming of the stars, for the faintest named Pleiad is actually Asterope.
                    Binoculars show dozens of stars in the Pleiades, and in all the cluster contains
                    a hundred or so members. The Pleiades lie about 440 light years away, nearly
                    three times the distance of the Hyades. They are relatively youthful by stellar
                    standards, the youngest being no more than a few million years old.
                    A famous myth links the Pleiades with Orion. As Hyginus tells it, Pleione and
                    her daughters were one day walking through Boeotia when Orion tried to ravish
                    her. Pleione and the girls escaped, but Orion pursued them for seven years. Zeus
                    immortalized the chase by placing the Pleiades in the heavens where Orion
                    follows them endlessly.
                    The eye, the horns – and a nebula named the Crab
                    The bull’s glinting red eye is marked by the brightest star in Taurus, Aldebaran,
                    a name that comes from the Arabic al-dabarān meaning ‘the follower’; according
                    to the 10th-century Arabic astronomer al-Ṣūfī, this name arose because it
                    follows the Pleiades across the sky. Surprisingly for such a prominent star, Greek
                    astronomers had no name for it (although Ptolemy called it Torch in his
                    Tetrabiblos, a book about astrology). Aldebaran appears to be a member of the
                    Hyades but in fact is a foreground object at less than half the distance, and so
                    is superimposed on the cluster by chance. It is a red giant star about 40 times
                    the diameter of the Sun. Aldebaran marks the right eye of the bull; the left eye
                    is represented by Epsilon Tauri, with Gamma Tauri on the nose. At the tip of the bull’s left horn is Beta Tauri, or Elnath, a name that comes
                    from the Arabic meaning ‘the butting one’. Ptolemy described this star as
                    being common with the right foot of Auriga, the charioteer, but since the introduction of rigorously defined constellation boundaries in 1930 it is now the
                    exclusive property of Taurus. Hence the bull has kept the tip of his horn, but
                    the charioteer has lost his right foot.
                    Near the tip of the bull’s right horn, which is marked by Zeta Tauri, lies the
                    remarkable Crab Nebula, the result of one of the most celebrated events in the
                    history of astronomy – a stellar explosion, seen from Earth in AD 1054, that was
                    bright enough to be visible in daylight for three weeks. We now know this this
                    event was a supernova, the violent death of a massive star, and the Crab Nebula
                    is the shattered remnant of the star that blew up, now visible only through tele -
                    scopes. The Irish astronomer Lord Rosse (1800–67) gave the nebula its name
                    in 1848 because he thought its shape resembled a crab. (Ridpath, 163-7)

The head and fore shoulders only of Taurus are repre-
sented on the celestial maps. There are many remarkable stars in this con-
stellation, which enable the observer to find it very easily. Aldebaran is a 
bright star of the first magnitude, in the right eye of Taurus; hence it is called 
the Bull's eye: it shines with a reddish light. A line drawn from the Pole 
star, between Auriga and Perseus, will point it out. It may also be found by 
drawing a line from Epsilon in the foot of Cassiopeia, through Alpha in Per-
seus. On examination it will be remarked, that Aldebaran forms the extre-
mity of a figure like the letter V, made by Theta, Nu, Delta and Epsilon. 
This cluster in the head of Taurus is called the Hyades. The beautiful little 
group called the Pleiades, is about midway between the Hyades and the Tri-
angles, a little to the north of a line drawn from Aldebaran to Alpha Arietis. 
Each of the stars which compose the Pleiades has a particular name, though 
they are all less than the fourth magnitude, except one of the third: this 
star, owing to its superior brightness, is called Lucida Pleiadum. This cluster 
of Taurus, which is now found on his fore shoulder, was by the ancients 
placed in the brush of the tail. Beta and Zeta, in the tips of the horns, form 
with Aldebaran very nearly a right-angled triangle. Beta in the northern 
horn, is also in the foot of Auriga, as we have already mentioned. Zeta in the 
southern horn, is a little to the south of Beta. Both these stars are on the 
edge of the Milky Way, and the ecliptic passes just hetween them.
Taurus is bounded by Auriga, Perseus, Musca, Aries, Cetus, Harpa Geor-
gii, Eridanus, and Orion.
Taurus is the second sign of the zodiac, and is represented by the follow-
ing character, tf; which bears some likeness to the face and horns of a bull. 
History.The Greeks have fabled that this sign commemorates the ani-
mal which bore Europa safely across the sea to Crete. It is probable that it 
had a place in the zodiac before the Greeks gave any attention to the stars. 
In eastern idolatry we know that the bull was one of their principal deities. 
The Egyptians worshipped Apis, and the Persians, Mithras, under the form of 
this animal; but whether the reverence which mankind entertained for it, was 
the cause of its being placed among the stars, we cannot discover. Belzoni 
found in one of the sepulchres near Thebes an embalmed bull. This symbol 
may have had reference to the Egyptian idol Osiris, or to some astrological su-
perstition connected with the sign Taurus.
The Hyades and the Pleiades are sometimes considered as separate con-
stellations, but they form a part of Taurus. The five stars in the Hyades are 
thought by some to represent the five daughters of Atlas, king of Mauritania. 
Their names were Phaola, Ambrosia, Eudora, Colonis and Polyxo: they all 
died through grief for the loss of their brother Hyas, and became these stars. 
The ancients supposed that the rising and setting of the Hyades was always 
attended with much rain. The Pleiades, in Grecian fable, are seven daughters 
of Atlas, and sisters to the Hyades; their names were Alcyone, Merope, Maia, 
Electra, Tayeta, Sterope, and Celene. After death, they were all placed in the 
heavens. Merope was the only sister who married a mortal, and it is on this 
account that her star is fainter than the rest. The Pleiades, on some ancient 
maps, are represented by a hen and chickens. The rising of this little group 
in the land of Uz during the spring season, is thus beautifully noticed in the 
thirty-eighth chapter of Job. "Canst thou bind the sweet influences of the 
Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his 
season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?"
In the Hebrew zodiac, Taurus is thought to refer to Joseph. (Green, 66-8)</note>-->

                    <p>Given <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s familiarity with the air pump through his reading, it is puzzling that he substituted a constellation associated with geometry,

                        Because of this abandonment of mankind, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VIRGO">Virgo</name> is represented with wings. This change from the Golden Age to the Silver Age

                    <p>For <persName corresp="#JGREEN">Green</persName>, description of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VIRGO">Virgo</name> touches off controversy over calculating the age of the world. 
                        Just as, in discussing <ref type="internal" target="#LEOGLOSS">Leo</ref>, he rails against &#x201C;antiquaries&#x201D; who date relics of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ZODIAC">Zodiac</name> signs 
                        based on the precession of the equinoxes, arriving at conclusions that conflict with the numbering of generations listed in the <title type="scripture" corresp="#KJV">Bible</title>, 
                        so <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VIRGO">Virgo</name>&#x02BC;s ancient connection with the autumn equinox prompts his indignation with the &#x201C;modern philosopher&#x201D; whose &#x201C;speculations&#x201D; lead to impiety:
                        &#x201C;We have mentioned that the sign <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEO">Leo</name> commences the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ZODIAC">zodiac</name> of <placeName corresp="#DENDERA">Dendera</placeName>; 
                        but another zodiac has been discovered in <placeName corresp="#EGYPT">Egypt</placeName> at <placeName corresp="#ESNEH">Estn&#x00E9;</placeName>, carved on a portico 
                        among the ruins at that place, commencing with the sign <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VIRGO">Virgo</name>; and from this circumstance it has been argued, 
                        that it must be at least two thousand years older than the one at <placeName corresp="#DENDERA">Dendera</placeName>. 
                        Some late discoveries respecting Egyptian writing, made by <persName corresp="#JFC">M. Champollion</persName>, 
                        have rendered it more than probable, that this ancient relic of astrology at <placeName corresp="#ESNEH">Estn&#x00E9;</placeName> 
                        was erected during the reign of the emperor <persName corresp="#CLAUDIUS">Claudius</persName>, and that it could have preceded the one at <placeName corresp="#DENDERA">Dendera</placeName> at most 
                        but by the duration of his reign, which continued only fourteen years. . . . We should have passed this subject without notice, 
                        if the spirit of modern inquiry did not strangely connect the speculations of science, 
                        and even those of fancy, with the truths of revealed religion. The modern philosopher rejects as fabulous 
                        the chronology of the <title type="scripture" corresp="#KJV">Bible</title>, established on the uninterrupted evidence of a series of generations, and, by a wonderful inconsistency and credulity, 
                        places implicit faith in the uncertain interpretation of Egyptian signs and hieroglyphics, the date and the meaning of which are unknown&#x201D;

                        <persName corresp="#JGREEN">Green</persName>&#x02BC;s objections, by exposing the supposed unscientific procedures of his adversaries, reflect the influence of <persName corresp="#TCHALMERS">Thomas Chalmers</persName>&#x02BC;s approach to the &#x201C;evidences&#x201D; of <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christianity</orgName> in relation to science 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#LEOGLOSS">Leo</ref>).</p>
                    
                    <p><persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>, for his part, appears to found no grounds for contradiction. If <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VIRGO">Virgo</name> once coincided with the vernal rather than autumnal equinox, 
                        &#x201C;that <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ZODIAC">zodiac</name> carries us back 90&#xb0; on the Ecliptic, and its date must be fixed about 6450 years ago. 
                        This deduction, according to the chronology of the Sacred Writings, carries us back to the earliest ages of the human species on earth, 
                        and proves, at least, that Astronomy was among the first studies of mankind. 
                        The most rational way of accounting for this <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ZODIAC">zodiac</name> seems to be, by assigning it to the family of <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#NOAH">Noah</persName>, 
                        or perhaps to the patriarch himself; in which case it may be considered as a monument that perpetuates the actual state of the heavens 
                        immediately subsequent to the creation. In short, if it be fact, as appears, that <persName type="astronomical" corresp="#NOAH">Noah</persName> himself travelled eastward after the deluge, 
                        and his whole life leads us to believe he was versed in all the science of his time, 
                        he might also transmit to his posterity, the zodiac of the antedeluvians, without the equator or ecliptic. 
                        But though <geogName corresp="#ASIA">Asia</geogName> might thus become the cradle of Astronomy, the stargazers of ancient <placeName corresp="#EGYPT">Egypt</placeName> in process of time were, without doubt, 
                        instructed in the true system of the world; and attributed the order which reigns in nature to the wisdom of a supreme and eternal First Cause, 
                        though they publicly chimed in with die popular errors of the multitude&#x201D;

                    <p><name type="astronomical" corresp="#LIBRA">Libra</name> bore differing meaning and significance for the Greeks and for the Romans&#x2014;a difference reflected

                        His initial idea, playing on a name for <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LIBRA">Libra</name> as &#x201C;the scales&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;the balance&#x201D;, 
                        relates to the Greek notion that the constellation &#x201C;perpetuate[d] the memory of <persName corresp="#MOCHUS">Mochus</persName>, the inventor of weights and measures&#x201D;

                        In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s figure, because the scales are aerial, they &#x201C;nothing to weigh would bear&#x201D;, and &#x201C;yet contain a thousand more&#x201D; (stars, presumably), 
                        perhaps even &#x201C;more than than the milky way&#x201D; contains.</p>
                    
                    <p>In his revision, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> substitutes the Roman interpretation of the scales as a balance of justice, 
                        &#x201C;in which twas vainly said / The crimes and virtues of men were weighed&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;vainly&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> presumably means, because pagan justice 
                        has been superceded by <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christian</orgName> judgment. <persName corresp="#IRIDPATH">Ridpath</persName> explains why the representation of balanced justice made <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LIBRA">Libra</name> a &#x201C;favoured constellation&#x201D; for the Romans: 
                        &#x201C;The <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MOON">Moon</name> was said to have been in <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LIBRA">Libra</name> when <placeName corresp="#ROME">Rome</placeName> was founded&#x201D;. Thus, according to the Roman writer <persName corresp="#MANILIUS">Manilius</persName> in the <title type="poem" corresp="#MANILIUSASTRONOMICA"><hi rend="italic">Astronomica</hi></title>, 
                        &#x201C;What sign would better have the care of Italy . . . than that which controls all, knows the weights of things, marks totals, and separates the unequal from the equal, the sign in which the seasons are balanced and the hours of night and day match each other?&#x201D; 
                        For it is given to <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> in turn to control all. <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> &#x201C;belongs to the Balance, her rightful sign: beneath it <placeName corresp="#ROME">Rome</placeName> and her sovereignty of the world were founded. <placeName corresp="#ROME">Rome</placeName>, 
                        which controls the issue of events, exalting and depressing nations placed in the scales: beneath this sign was born the emperor, who has now effected a better foundation of the city and governs a world which hangs on his command alone&#x201D;

                        &#x201C;I have seen, during the night&#x2010;watches of the soldiers, a luminous appearance, like a star, attached to the javelins on the ramparts. 
                        They also settle on the yard&#x2010;arms and other parts of ships while sailing, producing a kind of vocal sound, like that of birds flitting about. 
                        When they occur singly they are mischievous, so as even to sink the vessels, and if they strike on the lower part of the keel, setting them on fire. 
                        When there are two of them they are considered auspicious, and are thought to predict a prosperous voyage. . . .

                    Since Ruskin has already introduced that older, prominent constellation, it is probable that he intended here its "little" nearby neighbor, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#TRIANGULUMMINUS">Triangulum Minus</name>, 
                    invented by <persName corresp="#JHEVELIUS">Hevelius</persName> and now obsolete. It is possible, however, that he had in mind Triangulum Australis (the Southern Triangle), 
                    a southern circumpolor constellation near the front hooves of Centaurus, which Jamieson shows on his plate 28, the "Southern Celestial Hemisphere", 
                    but which he omits from description in the text. (Green, often reliant on Jamieson's text, likewise omits mention the southern Triangle, and in his plate 4 omits depiction even of Triangulum Minus, 
                    confining his drawing to Triangulum Majus.)</p>
                    
                    <p>Triangulum Australis was among the southern constellations established by Dutch explorers, 
                        Keyser and de Houtman, and plotted by Plancius at the end of the sixteenth century

                    Capricornus (the Sea Goat) "is the first of the Winter, and the fourth of the Southern signs", which "the Sun enters . . . on the 21st of December, 
                    . . . the time of the Winter solstice, when the Earth make the transit from Gemini to Cancer. . . . At the period of the Winter solstice, 
                    the Sun being vertical to the tropic of Capricorn, the Southern hemisphere enjoys the same light, &#x0026;c. which the Northern hemisphere enjoyed 
                    on the 21st of June, when the Sun was vertical to the tropic of Cancer. It is then the middle of day at the South Pole, 
                    and the middle of night at the North Pole" (see <ref type="internal" target="#CANCERGLOSS"><name type="astronomical" corresp="#CANCER">Cancer (the Crab)</name></ref>. 
                    Precession, however, "places this sign in the station of Aquarius, and the Sun enters it about the 16th of January" 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Celestial Atlas</hi></title></ref>, 47).</p>
                    
                    <p>Ruskin's line bestows a poetic epithet on the sky rather than on the constellation, which in his description suggests nothing more than a barnyard goat. 
                        Capricornus, however, is a strange composite creature of goat and fish, a phenomenon that involves Jamieson in discussion of the sign's ancient history and etymology more than its legends, 
                        which he calls "lame". As if to draw attention away from the stories, Jamieson seems reluctant in his plate to exhibit the strangeness of the creature, 
                        highlighting realistically the goat that forms the upper half of the body, while only outlining the fishtail that forms its lower half--the latter space dominated 
                        by the drawing of Capricornus's near neighbor, Aquarius (plate 21) 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Celestial Atlas</hi></title></ref>, 46-47). 
                        In contrast, the artist who copied Jamieson's depictions for Urania's Mirror--the 
                        Reverend Richard Rouse Bloxam (1765-1840), possibly along with his spouse, Ann (1766-1835) 
                        (Ridpath, "Urania's Mirror")--exploited the amphibious weirdness of the creature 
                        by devoting a single card to Capricornus, without Aquarius (card 25) and by coloring its tail a scaly blue-green ending in a pink and yellow fin.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ruskin may have averted to the immaterial "arched sky", shying away from the Greek legends about Capricornus, if he knew them, which are mostly lascivious. Capricornus is said to be Pan, 
                        whose adventures both Jamieson and Green confine to the origin story of his metamorphosis: "On a certain occasion", 
                        as Green tells the story, "Pan, with some other deities, were feasting near the banks of the Nile, 
                        when suddenly the giant Typhon appeared among them. This occasioned so much terror that they all changed themselves into different 
                        forms and fled in every direction. Pan, who was the guardian of hunters and shepherds, plunged into the river;

                        creating an enchanting sound. Pan selected reeds of different lengths and stuck them together with wax to form the famous pipes of Pan, 
                        also called the syrinx" (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><persName corresp="#IRIDPATH">Ridpath</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><hi rend="italic">Star Tales</hi></title></ref>, 66). 
                        As told in Sandys's translation of Ovid, which is one source for Ruskin's epithet "arched" for the sky,
                        
                        Pan, when he thought he had his Syrinx claspt
                        Betweene his arms, Reeds for her body graspt.
                        He sighs: they, stir’d there-with, report againe
                        A mournefull sound, like one that did complaine.
                        Rapt with the musick; Yet, O sweet (said he)
                        Together ever thus converse will we.
                        Then, of unequall wax-joyn'd Reeds he fram'd
                        This seven-fold Pipe: of her 'twas Syrinx nam’d.

                <note xml:id="MILKYWAYGLOSS" resp="#DCH">The Milky Way is not, of course, a constellation, but a band of faint light crossing the sky, consisting of countless distant stars. Aratus wrote of the sky being
                    ‘cleft all around by a broad band’ which he called Γάλα (Gala, the Greek for
                    milk). Eratosthenes called it Κύκλος Γαλαξίας (Kýklos Galaxías), the circle of
                    milk. Ptolemy in the Almagest spelled the name γαλακτίας (galaktías).
                    The Roman writer Manilius compared the Milky Way to the luminous wake
                    of a ship. Ovid in his Metamorphoses described it as a road lined on either side
                    by the houses of distinguished gods – ‘the Palatine district of high heaven’, he
                    termed it. Along this road the gods supposedly travelled to the palace of Zeus.
                    Eratosthenes tells us that the Milky Way was the result of a trick played by
                    Zeus on his wife Hera so that she would suckle his illegitimate son Heracles and
                    hence make him immortal. Hermes laid the infant Heracles at Hera’s breast
                    while she was asleep, but when she woke and realized who the baby was –
                    perhaps by the strength with which he sucked – she pushed him away and her
                    milk squirted across the sky to form the Milky Way.
                    Manilius listed various explanations for the Milky Way that were current in
                    his day, both scientific and mythological. One suggestion was that it is the seam
                    where the two halves of the heavens are joined – or, conversely, where the two
                    halves are coming apart like a split in the ceiling, letting in light from beyond.
                    Alternatively, said Manilius, it might be a former path of the Sun, now covered
                    in ash where the sky was scorched. Some thought that it could mark the route
                    taken by Phaethon when he careered across the sky in the chariot of the Sun
                    god, Helios, setting the sky on fire (see Eridanus, pages 94–96). Yet again, noted
                    Manilius, it could be a mass of faint stars, an idea attributed to the Greek
                    philosopher Democritus of the fifth century BC, which we now know to be
                    correct. Finally, on a quasi-religious note, Manilius suggested that the Milky Way
                    could be the abode of the souls of heroes who had ascended to heaven.
                    In Chinese astronomy the Milky Way was Tianhe, the Celestial River, also
                    translatable as River of Heaven. Nine stars in Cygnus, including Deneb, represented Tianjin, a ford across the river at a point where it appeared to be
                    particularly shallow; the impression of shallowness comes about because a dark
                    cloud of dust in the local spiral arm of our Galaxy obscures part of the Milky
                    Way in this region.
                    To the Arabs of the Middle Ages the Milky Way was known as al-madjarra,
                    from a word meaning a place where something is pulled or drawn along, such
                    as a cart track. It seems that Arab scientists such as al-Bīrūnī (973–1048) understood the Milky Way’s true nature as a distant mass of stars, which was finally
                    confirmed by Galileo’s telescopic observations in 1610. (Ridpath, 184)

The Milky Way, or Galaxy as it is sometimes called, is certainly one of the 
most striking objects in the sky. When examined without the assistance of the 
telescope, it appears as a broad track or path, of a whitish colour, encompassing 
the heavens. Its form, its breadth, and its colour are various in different parts 
of its course; in some places it is dense and luminous, in others it is scattered 
and faint: its breadth is often not more than five degrees, and sometimes it is ten 
or sixteen. In some places it assumes a double path, but for the most part it is 
single. It may be traced in the heavens beginning near the head of Cepheus, 
about thirty degrees from the north pole, through the constellations Cassiopeia, 
Perseus, Auriga, and part of Orion and Gemini, where it crosses the Zodiac. 
In the southern hemisphere it takes in the Ship Argo, Charles's Oak, the Cross, 
the feet of the Centaur and the Altar. Here it divides into two branches, as it 
passes over the Zodiac again into the northern hemisphere. One branch runs 
through the tail of Scorpio, the bow of Sagittarius, the slucld of Sobieski, the 
feet of Antinous, Aquila, Delphinus, Sagitta, and the southern wing of Cygnus. 
The other branch passes through the upper part of the tail of Scorpio, the side 
of Serpentarius, Taurus Poniatovii, Anser, and the neck of Cygnus, where it 
unites with the other, and they then pass on to the head of Cepheus, where 
there is a small opening. There arc some traces of the same kind of light 
as that which is emitted from the Milky Way near the south pole, but they are 
small and faint.
Some ancient philosophers maintained that the Sun had once gone in this 
track before he entered the ecliptic, and that its whiteness proceeded from the 
remains of his light. The Poets had the odd fancy that the Galaxy was the 
path which their deities used in the heavens, and which led immediately to the 
abode of Jupiter. Milton alludes to this in the following lines: 
"A broad and ample road, whose dust is gold, 
And pavement stars, as stars to us appear 
Seen in the Galaxy." 
By the help of the telescope we now are able to demonstrate that this path or 
zone in the heavens, consists of an immense multitude of minute stars, seem-
ingly very close to each other, whose mingled light gives it the whitish tinge it 
usually assumes. Dr. Herschel considers it a stratum of nebulous matter, ana-
logous to that which appears in little spots in many other places, or that it is a 
continued assemblage of nebulae. The term nebula is applied to little specks 
which shine with a dim, hazy light. These are seldom distinguished with the 
naked eye, but if a good telescope be applied to them, they appear to be lumi-
nous spots of various figures, and may be resolved into little clusters of minute 
stars. The number of nebulae before the time of Herschel, was estimated at one hundred and 
three; but previous to April, 1784, he added four hundred and 
sixty to this list. Telescopes of a still greater power than the one he used would 
no doubt enable us to discover many more. Herschel has offered a bold and 
sublime theory on this subject. He supposes the starry heavens to be replete 
with these nebulae, and that each of them is a distinct and separate system, in-
dependent of the rest. The Milky Way he imagines to be that particular ne-
bula in which our Sun is placed, and from the numerous and accurate obser-
vations which he has made on nebulous appearances, he has certainly rendered his 
hypothesis very plausible. (Green, 19-20)</note>
