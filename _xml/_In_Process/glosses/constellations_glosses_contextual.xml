                        which is a small formation in the southern hemisphere, and which remains an officially recognized constellation today. 
                        It was created by the French astronomer, <persName corresp="#NLL">Nicolas&#x2010;Louis de Lacaille</persName> (<date notBefore="1713" notAfter="1762">1713&#x2013;62</date>); 
                        and while there is no way to prove <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s intent, it is reasonable to assume that he meant to celebrate the constellation honoring the British astronomer

                        who depicted it as a fox with a goose captured in its jaws. The haplessness of the bird may account for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s epithet of &#x201C;stupid&#x201D;,
                        but by dividing the constellation in two <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> also avoids drawing attention to the goose&#x02BC;s fate.
                        A precedent for separating the fox from the goose extends back to <persName corresp="#JHEVELIUS">Hevelius</persName> himself,
                        who named the constellation both as a single entity, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VULPECULAETANSER">Vulpecula <hi rend="italic">cum</hi> Anser</name>,

                    <p>Perhaps a predatory and carnivorous fox offended nineteenth&#x2010;century sensibility,

                        <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>&#x02BC;s claim to originality was evidently exaggerated, since, according to <persName corresp="#IRIDPATH">Ridpath</persName>, in <date when="1721">1721</date> an English cartographer, <persName corresp="#JSENEX">John Senex</persName> (<date notBefore="1678" notAfter="1740">1678&#x2013;1740</date>), 
                        combined the branch of golden apples with the three&#x2010;headed serpent to form the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CERBERUSETRAMUS">Cerberus et Ramus</name>, 
                        which then appeared in Heracles&#x02BC;s hand in <persName corresp="#JBODE">Johann Bode</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#URANOGRAPHIA"><hi rend="italic">Uranographia</hi></title> (<date when="1801">1801</date>)

                        The latter appears to be the source of <persName corresp="#JGREEN">Green</persName>&#x02BC;s rendering, which lacks <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>&#x02BC;s addition of the archery gear.</p>
                    
                    <p><persName corresp="#JGREEN">Green</persName> unpacks this representation with an ethical interpretation
                        of the hero &#x201C;celebrated in antiquity for his heroic valour and corporal strength. He is represented in a kneeling posture,
                        holding in his right hand a club, and in his left the Hesperidian branch, with the three&#x2010;headed <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CERBERUSCONSTELLATION">Cerberus</name>;
                        the skin of a lion covers his head and shoulders. This is the lion he killed in the forests in the neighbourhood of <placeName corresp="#NEMEA">Nem&#x00C6;a</placeName>,
                        and the celebrated Nem&#x00C6;an games were instituted to commemorate that event. [The astronomer] <persName corresp="#JHEVELIUS">Hevelius</persName> first placed in the hand of this hero the serpent
                        with three heads, or <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CERBERUSCONSTELLATION">Cerberus</name>. The Hesperidian branch, bearing the golden apples, is probably of a more ancient date. . . .
                        <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HERCULES">Hercules</persName>, among many other achievements, . . . procured some of these golden apples from the <placeName type="fictional" corresp="#HESPERIDES">Hesperides</placeName>,
                        by killing the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#DRACO">Dragon [Draco]</name>. . . . [i]t is stated by the mythologists, that he brought upon earth the three&#x2010;headed monster <name type="animal" corresp="#CERBERUS">Cerberus</name>,
                        which guarded the entrance to <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PLUTO">Pluto</persName>&#x02BC;s dominions. The victory which he obtained over <name type="animal" corresp="#CERBERUS">Cerberus</name>, is thought by some to denote his control
                        over his bad passions; for he is held out by the ancients as a pattern of virtue and piety. His judicious choice of virtue,
                        in preference to pleasure, is admirably described by <persName corresp="#XENOPHON">Xenophon</persName>&#x201D;
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><title type="book" corresp="#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><hi rend="italic">Astronomical Recreations</hi></title></ref>, 46&#x2013;47).</p>
                    
                    <p><persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName> proposes a more complex allegory, which he integrates with the constellation&#x02BC;s astronomical season: 
                        &#x201C;The Three Headed <name type="animal" corresp="#CERBERUS">Cerberus</name>, like the triform <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HECATE">Hecate</persName>, 
                        was a lunar symbol, and <name type="animal" corresp="#CERBERUS">Cerberus</name> brought back to the day by <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HERCULES">Hercules</persName>, in his 12th labour, 
                        appears to some, as an astronomical fable, relating to the arrival of the Sun in <name type="astronomical" corresp="#SCORPIO">Scorpius</name>, or <hi rend="italic">Lesha</hi>, at the autumnal equinox. 
                        Thus <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HERCULES">Hercules</persName> is rendered partly an historical and partly an allegorical personage; and this combination is obviously the basis of the ingenious and elegant mythology of the Greeks. . . . 
                        If <name type="animal" corresp="#CERBERUS">Cerberus</name> be considered allegorically as the symbol of the earth, or more properly of all&#x2010;devouring time, 
                        his three months will represent the present, past, and future. The victory which <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HERCULES">Hercules</persName> obtained over this monster is thought to denote the conquest this hero acquired over his passions&#x201D;

                        was one among twelve southern constellations introduced to European sky charts in the <date notBefore="1567" notAfter="1599">late sixteenth century</date>, 
                        based on observations of the sky south of the equator the Dutch navigators, 
                        <persName corresp="#PDK">Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser</persName> and <persName corresp="#FdeH">Frederick de Houtman</persName>. 
                        The name <name type="astronomical" corresp="#APUS"><hi rend="italic">Apus</hi></name> was derived 
                        from the Greek for <hi rend="italic">without foot</hi>, since, as <persName corresp="#IRIDPATH">Ridpath</persName> explains, 
                        specimens originally obtained from <placeName corresp="#NEWGUINEA">New Guinea</placeName> by Europeans were skins from which the birds&#x02BC; feet had been removed, 
                        leading to speculation that these fabulous birds, with their long and colorful plummage, remained permanently in flight

                    <p>According to <persName corresp="#RHA">Richard Hinckley Allen</persName>, the constellation may have acquired the name, the Swallow, 
                        by way of the common English name for <persName corresp="#CLINNAEUS">Linnaeus</persName>&#x02BC;s species name, <hi rend="italic">Hirundo apus</hi>, 
                        which is also applied to the swift&#x2010;birds associated with the approach of summer

It is not clear, however, that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> identified the Swallow or Hirundo with the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#APUS">Apus</name> at all. 
                        These two constellations are listed separately in <title type="book" corresp="#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><hi rend="italic">An Introduction to Astronomy Intended for Little Children</hi> (<date when="1817">1817</date>)</title> by <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName> (<date notBefore="1775" notAfter="1851">1775&#x2013;1851</date>).

                       according to <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>. For <date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1899">nineteenth&#x2010;century</date> British observers, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#SCORPIO">Scorpio</name> was considered a late autumn sign, 
                        <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName> dating the sun&#x02BC;s entry into its path on November 20. It is situated opposite in the sky to <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>, rising as the latter sets, 
                        thus presenting a germ of its myth, since <name type="astronomical" corresp="#SCORPIO">Scorpio</name>&#x02BC;s sting caused the death of the hunter. As <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName> summarizes the stories, both mythological and naturalistic, 
                        the Scorpion was sent by <persName type="fictional" corresp="#DIANA">Diana</persName> &#x201C;to wound <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> for usurping her office.

                        which he could not conquer. Again, it is said that Autumn, which produces fruits in great abundance, brings with it a variety of diseases; 
                        and this season is very fitly represented by a Scorpion, which wounds with its tail as it recedes&#x201D;

                    and included among the twelve constellations that <persName corresp="#PPLANCIUS">Plancius</persName> devised in <date when="1598">1598</date>, based on observations by his fellow Dutchmen,

                    &#x201C;<name type="astronomical" corresp="#ARIES">Aries</name> is the first of the old <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ZODIAC">zodiacal</name> constellations. About four thousand

                    found in the sign <name type="astronomical" corresp="#PISCES">Pisces</name>, within which it has remained about 2000 years&#x201D;. 
                    According to <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName> writing in <date when="1822">1822</date>, the sun then entered <name type="astronomical" corresp="#PISCES">Pisces</name> on about <date when="1822-03-06">6 March</date> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ARIES">Aries</name> on about <date when="1822-04-22">22 April</date>. 
                    Thus, the vernal equinox, which falls on 20&#x2013;21 March, occurs when the ecliptic appears oriented toward <name type="astronomical" corresp="#PISCES">Pisces</name>

                        The North Pole is just coming into the light, and the Sun is vertical to the Equator, which,

                        As <persName corresp="#IRIDPATH">Ridpath</persName> goes on to explain, thanks to <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MYRTILUS">Myrtilus</persName>&#x02BC;s horse training,

                        leading her to persuade <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MYRTILUS">Myrtilus</persName> to tamper with the king&#x02BC;s chariot. <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MYRTILUS">Myrtilus</persName> agreed since he was in love with the girl himself,

                    <p><persName corresp="#JGREEN">Green</persName> links the constellation to a story about another dolphin,&#x201C;&#x201C;which saved the life of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#ARION">Arion</persName>, 
                        the famous lyric poet and musician of <placeName corresp="#LESBOS">Lesbos</placeName>. . . . <persName type="fictional" corresp="#ARION">Arion</persName>, who had obtained

                        wealth to his native country. The sailors of the ship in which he had embarked, 
                        determined to murder him to obtain his riches. Aware of their infamous designs, 
                        he begged to be permitted before his death to play some melodious tunes, 
                        which as soon as he had finished he threw himself into the sea. 
                        A number of Dolphins had been attracted round the ship by the sweetness of the music, 
                        and it is said that one of them supported <persName type="fictional" corresp="#ARION">Arion</persName> on his back, and brought him safe to land.

                        This story, <persName corresp="#IRIDPATH">Ridpath</persName> explains, was passed down by <persName corresp="#HYGINUS">Hyginus</persName> and

                    <p>From the time of <persName corresp="#PTOLOMY">Ptolomy</persName>, the altar was imagined with its base oriented to the north and with flames rising from its top, oriented to the southern pole, 
                        and those visual elements were carried into modern representations 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><persName corresp="#IRIDPATH">Ridpath</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><hi rend="italic">Star Tales</hi></title></ref>, 47). 
                        It seems not just the depiction of flames, however, that moved <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>, 
                        to insert the epithet <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ARA">&#x201C;gods fire&#x201D;</name> in the line as originally drafted in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>; rather, 
                        his phrase suggests that he was forestalling association with the pagan rites involved in the myths originally connected with the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ARA">Altar</name>. 
                        The phrase &#x201C;god&#x02BC;s fire&#x201D; imposes a <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christian</orgName> typology on the altar flames, referring, e.g., to <title type="scripture" corresp="#LEV6_12-13">Leviticus 6:12&#x2013;13</title>: 
                        &#x201C;And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it, it shall not be put out: 
                        and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace&#x2010;offerings. 
                        The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar: it shall never go out&#x201D;. In a commentary on the passage in his popular annotated <title type="scripture" corresp="#SCOTTBIBLE">Bible</title>, 
                    <persName corresp="#TSCOTT">Thomas Scott</persName> (<date notBefore="1747" notAfter="1821">1747&#x2013;1821</date>) reads the Levitical rites as a type of the permanence of <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#CREATOR">God</persName>&#x02BC;s justice and <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName>&#x02BC;s redemption:
                        just as &#x201C;the fire on the altar was kindled from heaven&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#TSCOTT">Scott</persName> explains, &#x201C;and it must not be suffered to go out&#x201D;

                        and the perpetual efficacy of <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName>&#x02BC;s all&#x2010;sufficient atonement&#x201D;

                    <p>As an example of how the Leviticus verse was applied as a historical type from <title type="scriptural" corresp="#OLDTESTAMENT">Old Testament</title> to <title type="scriptural" corresp="#NEWTESTAMENT">New</title> in Evangelical discourse, 
                        a writer for the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title> cites &#x201C;the watchfulness of the [Levite] ministers of the sanctuary&#x2014;to preserve 
                    the sacred fire on the altar. As this was kindled from heaven, and it was unlawful to offer strange fire; 
                    the Levites watched to preserve the sacred flame from extinction, by supplying it with fuel night and day. 
                    In this way <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#CREATOR">God</persName> taught his ancient people the duty of watchfulness and incessant prayer, by rites and ceremonies, 
                    which accorded with the genius of that dispensation when the church was under age. But now that it is come to its majority, 
                    our <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#CREATOR">Lord</persName> instructs us in a more manly way, by addresses to our judgment, conscience, and hearts, which should lead us to . . . Watchfulness and Prayer&#x201D;

                        or they considered the small constellation too minor and too far south for English observers to merit a lengthy description, 
                        for ancient writers this altar in the sky ranked as &#x201C;a special one&#x201D;, according to <persName corresp="#IRIDPATH">Ridpath</persName>. 
                        As described by both the Greek writer, <persName corresp="#ERATOSTHANES">Eratosthenes</persName>, and the Roman writer, <persName corresp="#MANILIUS">Manilius</persName>, this altar was &#x201C;used by the gods themselves to swear a vow of allegiance 
                        before their fight against the Titans&#x201D;. According to legend, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#CRONUS">Cronus</persName>&#x2014;the chief of the most ancient gods, the giant Titans&#x2014;swallowed all his children in an attempt to thwart 
                        a prophesy that they would grow up to overthrow him. To prevent this fate befalling the latest child, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#JUPITERGOD">Zeus</persName>, 
                        <persName type="fictional" corresp="#CRONUS">Cronus</persName>&#x02BC;s wife, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#RHEA">Rhea</persName>, sent the infant to <placeName corresp="#CRETE">Crete</placeName> to be hidden in a cave.

                        When <persName type="fictional" corresp="#JUPITERGOD">Zeus</persName> had grown to maturity, he returned from <placeName corresp="#CRETE">Crete</placeName> and forced his father to vomit his siblings&#x2014;<persName type="fictional" corresp="#HESTIA">Hestia</persName>,

                    <!-- Ovid in his Fasti asserts that the name comes from the old
                    Greek word hyein, meaning ‘to rain’, so that Hyades means ‘rainy ones’, because
                    their rising at certain times of year was said to be a sign of rain. In mythology
                    the Hyades were the daughters of Atlas and Aethra the Oceanid. Their eldest
                    brother was Hyas, a bold hunter who one day was killed by a lioness. His sisters
                    wept inconsolably – Hyginus says they died of grief – and for this they were
                    placed in the sky. Hence it seems equally likely that their name comes from their
                    brother Hyas. In another story, the Hyades were nymphs who nursed the infant
                    Dionysus in their cave on Mount Nysa, feeding him on milk and honey. The
                    Romans had a different name: they called the Hyades suculae meaning ‘piglets’.
                    The mythographers were massively confused about the names and even the
                    number of the Hyades. They are variously described as being five or seven in
                    number. Ptolemy listed five Hyades in his star catalogue. Hyginus alone gives
                    four different lists of their names, none of which agrees completely with the list
                    of five given originally by Hesiod, namely Phaesyle, Coronis, Cleia, Phaeo, and
                    Eudore. Astronomers have avoided the problem by not naming any of the stars
                    of the Hyades.
                    The Hyades is a genuine cluster of stars lying about 150 light years away.
                    Binoculars and small telescopes show many more members of the Hyades than
                    are visible to the naked eye. In all, the cluster is estimated to contain several
                    hundred stars.
                    The Pleiades – seven celestial sisters
                    Even more famous than the Hyades is another star cluster in Taurus: the
                    Pleiades (Πλειάδες in Greek), commonly known as the Seven Sisters. To a
                    casual glance, the Pleiades cluster appears as a fuzzy patch like a swarm of flies
                    over the back of the bull. According to Hyginus, some ancient astronomers
                    called them the bull’s tail. So distinctive are the Pleiades that the ancient Greeks
                    regarded them as a separate mini-constellation and used them as a calendar marker. Hesiod, in his agricultural poem Works and Days, instructs farmers to
                    begin harvesting when the Pleiades rise at dawn, which in Greek times would
                    have been in May, and to plough when they set at dawn, which would have been
                    in November. Ptolemy did not list individual members of the Pleiades in his
                    Almagest, giving only an indication of the cluster’s size.
                    In mythology the Pleiades were the seven daughters of Atlas and the oceanid
                    Pleione, after whom they are named. One popular derivation is that the name
                    comes from the Greek word plein, meaning ‘to sail’ – so Pleione means ‘sailing
                    queen’ and the Pleiades are the ‘sailing ones’, because in Greek times they were
                    visible all night during the summer sailing season. When the Pleiades vanished
                    from the night sky, it was considered prudent to remain ashore. ‘Gales of all
                    winds rage when the Pleiades, pursued by violent Orion, plunge into the
                    clouded sea’, wrote Hesiod.
                    Alternatively, and possibly more likely, the name may come from the old
                    Greek word pleos, ‘full’, which in the plural meant ‘many’, a suitable reference to the cluster. According to other authorities, the name comes from the Greek
                    word peleiades, meaning ‘flock of doves’.
                    Unlike their half-sisters the Hyades, the names of all seven Pleiades are
                    assigned to stars in the cluster: Alcyone, Asterope, Celaeno, Electra, Maia,
                    Merope, and Taygeta. Two more stars are named after their parents, Atlas and
                    Pleione. Alcyone is the brightest star in the cluster. According to mythology,
                    Alcyone and Celaeno were both seduced by Poseidon. Maia, the eldest and most
                    beautiful of the sisters, was seduced by Zeus and gave birth to Hermes; she later
                    became foster-mother to Arcas, son of Zeus and Callisto. Zeus also seduced two
                    others of the Pleiades: Electra, who gave birth to Dardanus, the founder of
                    Troy; and Taygeta, who gave birth to Lacedaemon, founder of Sparta. Asterope
                    was ravished by Ares and became mother of Oenomaus, king of Pisa, near
                    Olympia, who features in the legend of Auriga. Hence six Pleiades became
                    paramours of the gods. Only Merope married a mortal, Sisyphus, a notorious
                    trickster who was subsequently condemned to roll a stone eternally up a hill.
                    Although the Pleiades are popularly termed the Seven Sisters, only six stars
                    are easily visible to the naked eye, and a considerable mythology has grown up
                    to account for the ‘missing’ Pleiad. Eratosthenes says that Merope was the faint
                    Pleiad because she was the only one who married a mortal. Hyginus and Ovid
                    also recount this story, giving her shame as the reason for her faintness, but both
                    add another candidate: Electra, who could not bear to see the fall of Troy, which
                    had been founded by her son Dardanus. Hyginus says that, moved by grief,
                    she left the Pleiades altogether, but Ovid says that she merely covered her eyes
                    with her hand. Astronomers, however, have not followed either legend in their
                    naming of the stars, for the faintest named Pleiad is actually Asterope.
                    Binoculars show dozens of stars in the Pleiades, and in all the cluster contains
                    a hundred or so members. The Pleiades lie about 440 light years away, nearly
                    three times the distance of the Hyades. They are relatively youthful by stellar
                    standards, the youngest being no more than a few million years old.
                    A famous myth links the Pleiades with Orion. As Hyginus tells it, Pleione and
                    her daughters were one day walking through Boeotia when Orion tried to ravish
                    her. Pleione and the girls escaped, but Orion pursued them for seven years. Zeus
                    immortalized the chase by placing the Pleiades in the heavens where Orion
                    follows them endlessly.
                    The eye, the horns – and a nebula named the Crab
                    The bull’s glinting red eye is marked by the brightest star in Taurus, Aldebaran,
                    a name that comes from the Arabic al-dabarān meaning ‘the follower’; according
                    to the 10th-century Arabic astronomer al-Ṣūfī, this name arose because it
                    follows the Pleiades across the sky. Surprisingly for such a prominent star, Greek
                    astronomers had no name for it (although Ptolemy called it Torch in his
                    Tetrabiblos, a book about astrology). Aldebaran appears to be a member of the
                    Hyades but in fact is a foreground object at less than half the distance, and so
                    is superimposed on the cluster by chance. It is a red giant star about 40 times
                    the diameter of the Sun. Aldebaran marks the right eye of the bull; the left eye
                    is represented by Epsilon Tauri, with Gamma Tauri on the nose. At the tip of the bull’s left horn is Beta Tauri, or Elnath, a name that comes
                    from the Arabic meaning ‘the butting one’. Ptolemy described this star as
                    being common with the right foot of Auriga, the charioteer, but since the introduction of rigorously defined constellation boundaries in 1930 it is now the
                    exclusive property of Taurus. Hence the bull has kept the tip of his horn, but
                    the charioteer has lost his right foot.
                    Near the tip of the bull’s right horn, which is marked by Zeta Tauri, lies the
                    remarkable Crab Nebula, the result of one of the most celebrated events in the
                    history of astronomy – a stellar explosion, seen from Earth in AD 1054, that was
                    bright enough to be visible in daylight for three weeks. We now know this this
                    event was a supernova, the violent death of a massive star, and the Crab Nebula
                    is the shattered remnant of the star that blew up, now visible only through tele -
                    scopes. The Irish astronomer Lord Rosse (1800–67) gave the nebula its name
                    in 1848 because he thought its shape resembled a crab. (Ridpath, 163-7)

The head and fore shoulders only of Taurus are repre-
sented on the celestial maps. There are many remarkable stars in this con-
stellation, which enable the observer to find it very easily. Aldebaran is a 
bright star of the first magnitude, in the right eye of Taurus; hence it is called 
the Bull's eye: it shines with a reddish light. A line drawn from the Pole 
star, between Auriga and Perseus, will point it out. It may also be found by 
drawing a line from Epsilon in the foot of Cassiopeia, through Alpha in Per-
seus. On examination it will be remarked, that Aldebaran forms the extre-
mity of a figure like the letter V, made by Theta, Nu, Delta and Epsilon. 
This cluster in the head of Taurus is called the Hyades. The beautiful little 
group called the Pleiades, is about midway between the Hyades and the Tri-
angles, a little to the north of a line drawn from Aldebaran to Alpha Arietis. 
Each of the stars which compose the Pleiades has a particular name, though 
they are all less than the fourth magnitude, except one of the third: this 
star, owing to its superior brightness, is called Lucida Pleiadum. This cluster 
of Taurus, which is now found on his fore shoulder, was by the ancients 
placed in the brush of the tail. Beta and Zeta, in the tips of the horns, form 
with Aldebaran very nearly a right-angled triangle. Beta in the northern 
horn, is also in the foot of Auriga, as we have already mentioned. Zeta in the 
southern horn, is a little to the south of Beta. Both these stars are on the 
edge of the Milky Way, and the ecliptic passes just hetween them.
Taurus is bounded by Auriga, Perseus, Musca, Aries, Cetus, Harpa Geor-
gii, Eridanus, and Orion.
Taurus is the second sign of the zodiac, and is represented by the follow-
ing character, tf; which bears some likeness to the face and horns of a bull. 
History.The Greeks have fabled that this sign commemorates the ani-
mal which bore Europa safely across the sea to Crete. It is probable that it 
had a place in the zodiac before the Greeks gave any attention to the stars. 
In eastern idolatry we know that the bull was one of their principal deities. 
The Egyptians worshipped Apis, and the Persians, Mithras, under the form of 
this animal; but whether the reverence which mankind entertained for it, was 
the cause of its being placed among the stars, we cannot discover. Belzoni 
found in one of the sepulchres near Thebes an embalmed bull. This symbol 
may have had reference to the Egyptian idol Osiris, or to some astrological su-
perstition connected with the sign Taurus.
The Hyades and the Pleiades are sometimes considered as separate con-
stellations, but they form a part of Taurus. The five stars in the Hyades are 
thought by some to represent the five daughters of Atlas, king of Mauritania. 
Their names were Phaola, Ambrosia, Eudora, Colonis and Polyxo: they all 
died through grief for the loss of their brother Hyas, and became these stars. 
The ancients supposed that the rising and setting of the Hyades was always 
attended with much rain. The Pleiades, in Grecian fable, are seven daughters 
of Atlas, and sisters to the Hyades; their names were Alcyone, Merope, Maia, 
Electra, Tayeta, Sterope, and Celene. After death, they were all placed in the 
heavens. Merope was the only sister who married a mortal, and it is on this 
account that her star is fainter than the rest. The Pleiades, on some ancient 
maps, are represented by a hen and chickens. The rising of this little group 
in the land of Uz during the spring season, is thus beautifully noticed in the 
thirty-eighth chapter of Job. "Canst thou bind the sweet influences of the 
Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his 
season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?"
In the Hebrew zodiac, Taurus is thought to refer to Joseph. (Green, 66-8)</note>-->

                    Virgo is the second-largest constellation in the sky, exceeded only by the much
                    fainter Hydra. The Greeks including Ptolemy called the constellation Παρθένος
                    (Parthenos). She is usually identified as Dike, goddess of justice, who was the
                    daughter of Zeus and Themis; but she is also known as Astraeia, daughter of
                    Astraeus (father of the stars) and Eos (goddess of the dawn). Virgo is depicted
                    with wings, reminiscent of an angel, holding an ear of wheat in her left hand
                    (the star Spica). Dike features as the impartial observer in a moral tale depicting
                    mankind’s declining standards. It was a favourite tale of Greek and Roman
                    mythologists, and its themes still sound familiar today.
                    Dike was supposed to have lived on Earth in the Golden Age of mankind,
                    when Cronus ruled Olympus. It was a time of peace and happiness, a season of perennial spring when food grew without cultivation and humans never grew
                    old. Men lived like the gods, not knowing work, sorrow, crime, or war. Dike
                    moved among them, dispensing wisdom and justice.
                    Then, when Zeus overthrew his father Cronus on Olympus, the Silver Age
                    began, inferior to the age that had just passed. In the Silver Age, Zeus shortened
                    springtime and introduced the yearly cycle of seasons. Humans in this age
                    became quarrelsome and ceased to honour the gods. Dike longed for the idyllic
                    days gone by. She assembled the human race and spoke sternly to them for
                    forsaking the ideals of their ancestors. ‘Worse is to come’, she warned them.
                    Then she spread her wings and took refuge in the mountains, turning her
                    back on mankind.
                    Finally came the Ages of Bronze and Iron, when humans descended into
                    violence, theft, and war. Unable to endure the sins of humanity any longer, Dike
                    abandoned the Earth and flew up to heaven, where she sits to this day next to
                    the constellation of Libra, which some see as the scales of justice.
                    Other identifications
                    There are other goddesses who can claim identity with Virgo. One is Demeter,
                    the corn goddess, who was daughter of Cronus and Rhea. By her brother
                    Zeus she had a daughter, Persephone (also called Kore, meaning ‘maiden’).
                    Persephone might have remained a virgin for ever had not her uncle, Hades,
                    god of the Underworld, kidnapped her while she was out picking flowers one
                    day at Henna in Sicily. Hades swept her aboard his chariot drawn by four black
                    horses and galloped with her into his underground kingdom, where she became
                    his reluctant queen.
                    Demeter, having scoured the Earth for her missing daughter without success,
                    cursed the fields of Sicily so that the crops failed. In desperation she asked the
                    Great Bear what he had seen, for he never sets, but since the abduction had
                    taken place during the day he referred her to the Sun, who finally told her the
                    unwelcome truth.
                    Demeter angrily confronted Zeus, father of Persephone, and demanded that
                    he order his brother Hades to return the girl. Zeus agreed to try; but already it
                    was too late, because Persephone had eaten some pomegranate seeds while in
                    the Underworld and, once having done that, she could never return permanently to the land of the living. A compromise was reached in which Persephone
                    would spend half (some say one-third) of the year in the Underworld with her
                    husband, and the rest of the year above ground with her mother. Clearly, this
                    is an allegory on the changing seasons.
                    Eratosthenes offers the additional suggestion that Virgo might be Atargatis,
                    the Syrian fertility goddess, who was sometimes depicted holding an ear of corn.
                    But this seems to be a mistake because Atargatis is identified with the constellation Piscis Austrinus. Hyginus, more plausibly, equates Virgo with Erigone, the
                    daughter of Icarius, who hanged herself after the death of her father. In this
                    story, Icarius became the constellation Boötes, which adjoins Virgo to the north,
                    and Icarius’s dog Maera became the star Procyon (see Boötes, page 54, and
                    Canis Minor, page 64). Eratosthenes and Hyginus both name Tyche, the goddess of fortune, as
                    another identification of Virgo; but Tyche was usually represented holding the
                    horn of plenty (cornucopia) rather than an ear of grain. In the sky, the ear of
                    corn is represented by the first-magnitude star Spica, a Latin name meaning
                    ‘ear of grain’. The name in Greek, Στάχυς (Stachys), has the same meaning.
                    Beta Virginis is called Zavijava, from an Arabic name meaning ‘the angle’;
                    in the Almagest, Ptolemy located this star on the top of Virgo’s left wing. Gamma
                    Virginis, also in the left wing, is called Porrima, after a Roman goddess. According to Ovid in his Fasti, Porrima and her sister Postverta were the sisters or
                    companions of the prophetess Carmenta. Porrima sang of events in the past,
                    while Postverta sang of what was to come.
                    Epsilon Virginis, on Virgo’s right wing, is named Vindemiatrix, from the
                    Latin meaning ‘grape-gatherer’ or ‘vintager’, because its first visible rising before
                    the Sun in August marked the beginning of each year’s vintage. Ovid in his Fasti
                    tells us that this star commemorates a boy named Ampelus (the Greek word for
                    ‘vine’) who was loved by Dionysus, god of wine. While picking grapes from a
                    vine that trailed up an elm tree, Ampelus fell from a branch and was killed;
                    Dionysus placed him among the stars.
                    This star’s original Greek name, Προτρυγητήρ (Protrygeter), also means
                    ‘grape gatherer’, the same as in Latin. Its importance as a calendar star is
                    demonstrated by the fact that it was one of the few stars named by Aratus and,
                    at third magnitude, was far fainter than the others.
                    Virgo, incidentally, contains the autumnal equinox, the point at which the
                    Sun crosses the celestial equator heading south; this occurs on September 22 or
                    23 each year. In ancient times the autumnal equinox lay in Libra, and hence it
                    is still sometimes referred to as ‘the first point of Libra’. However, because of
                    the effect of precession, the autumnal equinox crossed the modern constellation
                    boundary from Libra into Virgo around 730 BC. It continues to move, and will
                    eventually reach Leo in AD 2439. (Ridpath, 170-81)

This sign contains a beautiful star of the first magnitude, 
called Spica. A line drawn from Beta in the head of Bootes, through Arctu-
rus, will lead to Spica, which forms a triangle almost equilateral with Deneb in 
the tail of Leo, and Arcturus. The ecliptic passes a little to the north of Spica. 
A line drawn from Arcturus, between Eta and Upsilon in the ancle of Bootes, 
will show us Vindemiatrix or Epsilon in the northern wing and arm of Virgo. 
The same line produced will point out Beta near the base of the southern wing. 
If from this star a line be drawn a little to the north of Spica, it will pass Eta, 
Gamma and Theta; and by producing it a short distance beyond Theta, it will 
show us Kappa and Lambda in the southern foot. A little to the north of the 
two last mentioned stars are Iota and Phi in the robe, and Mu in the northern 
foot. Between Gamma and Epsilon we find Delta; between Delta and Beta 
we find c on the bosom; and between Spica and Arcturus is Zeta, very near 
the equator. The head of the Virgin is marked by four small stars in a quad-
rilateral figure, about half way between Beta on the southern wing and the tail 
of the Lion.
Virgo is bounded by Bootes, Coma Berenices, Leo, Hydra, and Libra.
On some of the relics of antiquity which have descended to us, this con-
stellation is represented by a female, with an ear of com or with a small sheaf 
of wheat in her hand. The Arabians and Persians have drawn her with an infant 
in her arms. In the oriental zodiac of Sir William Jones, this Virgin stands in 
a boat, holding in one hand a lamp, and in the other a bunch of the rice plant.
We have mentioned that the sign Leo commences the zodiac of Dendera; 
but another zodiac has been discovered in Egypt at Estne, carved on a portico 
among the ruins at that place, commencing with the sign Virgo; and from this 
circumstance it has been argued, that it must be at least two thousand years 
older than the one at Dendera. Some late discoveries respecting Egyptian 
writing, made by M. Champollion, have rendered it more than probable, that 
this ancient relic of astrology at Estne was erected during the reign of the em-
peror Claudius, and that it could have preceded the one at Dendera at most 
but by the duration of his reign, which continued only fourteen years. From 
the remarks we have made on the antiquity of the zodiacs at Dendera, and 
the hint here given respecting the discoveries of Champollion, it will be 
seen that no important chronological inquiry can be determined by these cu-
rious relics of Egyptian ingenuity. We should have passed this subject without 
notice, if the spirit of modern inquiry did not strangely connect the speculations 
of science, and even those of fancy, with the truths of revealed religion. The 
modern philosopher rejects as fabulous the chronology of the Bible, established 
on the uninterrupted evidence of a series of generations, and, by a wonderful 
inconsistency and credulity, places implicit faith in the uncertain interpreta-
tion of Egyptian signs and hieroglyphics, the date and the meaning of which 
are unknown. No attention is paid by him to the proofs which confirm the 
records of the sacred historians, and without being able or without attempting 
fairly to destroy them, he boldly returns to the charge of their insufficiency 
whenever opportunity offers, whether it be in a vein of granite, or in the frag-
ment of an Egyptian ruin.
Virgo is the sixth sign in the zodiac, and is represented by the following 
figure, n; a character which we are unable to explain.
History.--Various accounts have been given of the origin of this sign.
Some say that the Virgin here placed in the skies was, while on earth, Justi-
tia, who lived in the golden age and taught mankind their duty; but who, when 
their crimes increased, was obliged to leave the earth and take her place in 
the heavens. Others say that she is Ceres. The ear of corn which this ce-
lestial maid holds in her hand, evidently denotes the time of harvest, among 
the people who invented this sign.
In the Hebrew zodiac Virgo alludes to Naphthali. (Green, 79-81)</note>

                <note xml:id="TRIANGULAGLOSS" resp="#DCH">Since any three points make up the corners of a triangle it is unsurprising, if
                    somewhat unimaginative, to find a triangle among the constellations. Aratus
                    and Eratosthenes knew this constellation as Δελτωτόν (Deltoton), because its shape resembled a capital delta (Δ), while Ptolemy in the Almagest listed it as
                    Τρίγωνον (Trigonon), triangle.
                    Aratus described it as an isosceles triangle, having two equal sides and a
                    shorter third side. Eratosthenes said that it represented the Nile river delta.
                    According to Hyginus, some people also saw it as the island of Sicily, which was
                    originally known as Trinacria on account of its three promontories. In mythology, Trinacria was the home of Ceres, goddess of agriculture.
                    Alpha Trianguli, magnitude 3.4, is named Mothallah, which comes from the
                    Arabic name for the constellation, al-muthallath, meaning ‘the triangle’. The
                    brightest star in Triangulum is actually Beta Trianguli, magnitude 3.0, but this
                    has no name. Triangulum contains M33, a galaxy in our Local Group sometimes popularly termed the Pinwheel Galaxy, visible with binoculars.
                    A lesser triangle
                    A smaller triangle, Triangulum Minus, was introduced in 1687 by the Polish
                    astronomer Johannes Hevelius who formed it from three stars next to Triangulum. He renamed the existing Triangulum as Triangulum Majus to distinguish
                    it from the smaller sibling. Triangulum Minus was shown on some charts, such
                    as the one reproduced here, but has since fallen into disuse (see also page 207). (Ridpath, 168-9)

A little to the south of the southern foot of Andromeda 
three stars of the fourth magnitude may be seen, in the form of a triangle. It 
will be unnecessary to enter into any particular detail of the manner of finding 
them, as their relative position may be easily ascertained by a reference to the 
map. Two triangles, the Greater and Lesser, are commonly marked on ce-
lestial globes; but as the stars which compose the smaller one, are not of a 
sufficient magnitude to be embraced by our plan, we have not sketched it. 
There is a fine nebula near the Great Triangle, a tittle towards the north, 
which exhibits a continued and regular whitish light. No minute stars can be 
distinguished in it.
The Triangle is bounded by Perseus, Andromeda, Piscis Borealis, Aries, 
and Musca.
History.--According to the Poets, Jupiter assigned the island of Sicily a 
place in the heavens, under the figure of a Triangle. Others say, that the 
large Triangle, owes its origin to some one who wished to represent the figure 
of the Delta in Egypt, among the stars. Although uncertainty hangs over the 
history of the large Triangle, we know that Hevelius introduced the small one, 
which is contiguous to it. The stars which form the small figure can be dis-
tinguished under favourable circumstances. (Green, 40-1)</note>

                <note xml:id="MONOCEROSGLOSS" resp="#DCH">The mythical single-horned beast, the unicorn, is represented by this constellation which was unknown to the ancient Greeks. Monoceros was first depicted
                    in 1612 under the name Monoceros Unicornis on a globe by the Dutch theologian and cartographer Petrus Plancius. This was the same globe on which
                    Camelopardalis, another of his inventions, first appeared.
                    In 1624 the German astronomer Jacob Bartsch depicted it under the name
                    Unicornu (sic) on a star chart in his book Usus Astronomicus Planisphaerii Stellati
                    and as a result he was sometimes wrongly credited with its invention. In his
                    book, Bartsch pointed to several passages in the Bible that supposedly mention
                    unicorns, although these are now regarded as mistranslations. It is not clear
                    whether Plancius introduced the constellation because of these Biblical references, but the unicorn has long been regarded as a Christian symbol of purity.
                    Perhaps Plancius had in mind the Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries woven in the southern Netherlands around a century earlier. The Polish astronomer Johannes
                    Hevelius adopted Monoceros in his influential star atlas and catalogue published
                    in 1690 which ensured its acceptance by other astronomers.
                    Monoceros fills a large area between Hydra and Orion where there was no
                    Greek constellation. It is not prominent (its brightest stars are of fourth mag -
                    nitude) but it lies in the Milky Way and contains a host of fascinating objects,
                    most notably the Rosette Nebula, a wreath-shaped mass of glowing gas with
                    embedded stars. There are no legends associated with the constellation, as it is
                    a modern figure, and none of its stars is named. (Ridpath, 125-6)

                <note xml:id="LIBRAGLOSS" resp="#DCH">In ancient Greek times, the area of sky we know as Libra was occupied by the
                    claws of the scorpion, Scorpius. The Greeks called this area Χηλαί (Chelae),
                    literally meaning ‘claws’, an identification that lives on in the names of the individual stars of Libra (see below). As things have worked out, Libra is now a
                    slightly larger constellation than Scorpius, but is much less conspicuous.
                    The identification of this area with a balance became established in the first
                    century BC among the Romans, although exactly when it was introduced and
                    by whom has been lost in the mists of history. Ptolemy in the Almagest, written
                    around AD 150, continued to refer to this constellation as the Claws, preferring
                    to follow Greek tradition even though it was by then being superseded – for
                    example, Libra was shown as a pair of scales on the celestial globe held by the
                    Farnese Atlas, a Roman statue produced about the same time that the Almagest
                    was being written (see page 27 and Fig. 3).
                    To the Romans, Libra was a favoured constellation. The Moon was said to
                    have been in Libra when Rome was founded. ‘Italy belongs to the Balance, her
                    rightful sign. Beneath it Rome and her sovereignty of the world were founded’, said the Roman writer Manilius. He described Libra as ‘the sign in which the
                    seasons are balanced, and the hours of night and day match each other’. This
                    is a hint that the Romans visualized Libra as a balance because the Sun lay
                    within it at the autumnal equinox, when day and night are equal. However, the
                    idea of a balance in this area did not originate with the Romans. The Babylonians knew this area as ZIB.BA.AN.NA, the balance of heaven, around 1000 BC,
                    when the autumnal equinox lay among its stars. Hence it seems that the
                    Romans revived a constellation that existed even before Greek times.
                    Libra is the only constellation of the zodiac to represent an inanimate object;
                    the other 11 zodiacal constellations represent animals or mythological characters. Once the identification of Libra with a pair of scales became established
                    it was natural to divorce it entirely from Scorpius and to associate it instead
                    with the other flanking zodiacal figure, Virgo, who was identified with Dike or
                    Astraeia, goddess of justice. Libra thus became the scales of justice held aloft
                    by the goddess – although, in the sky, they were positioned at her feet.
                    Libra’s brightest star, second-magnitude Alpha Librae, is called Zubenelgenubi from the Arabic meaning ‘the southern claw’, a reminder of the Greek
                    identification of this constellation with the claws of the scorpion. Beta Librae
                    is Zubeneschamali, ‘the northern claw’. (Ridpath, 116-7)

This sign may be seen to the south-east of the Virgin. 
The scales of the Balance are marked by two stars of the second magnitude, 
one a little above the other. Alpha in the southern scale or basin, may be 
known by following the line of stars in the southern wing and foot of Virgo. 
Beta, in the northern scale, is near Alpha, and on a line between it and Lyra. 
Beta also forms with Arcturus and Spica, a triangle almost equilateral. Iota 
and Gamma, stars of the third magnitude, form a quadrilateral figure with 
Alpha and Beta.
Libra is bounded by Ophiuchus, Virgo, Hydra, Lupus, and Scorpio.
In Sir W. Jones's zodiac a female figure, holding a balance in her hand, 
represents this sign. In the zodiacs at Dendera and Estne, we have the ba-
lance only. The figure of a balance was no doubt given to this constellation, 
because, when the sun arrived in this part of the ecliptic, the days and nights 
were equal,--there was also a great uniformity in the temperature of the air 
over the surface of the earth at this season. Virgil mentions this cluster in 
his Georgics.
Libra die somnique pares ubi fecerit horas
Et medium luci atqne urabris jam dividct orbem.
The Balance was introduced into the Roman zodiac, and perhaps was first 
added to the constellations, in the time of Julius Caesar. Before this, the place 
of Libra was occupied by the projecting claws of the Scorpion. If this suppo-
sition be true, the zodiacs of Dendera and Estne, and others which contain 
this sign, cannot be dated farther back than the reign of that emperor. Hum-
boldt, in his magnificent work on the monuments of the native American na-
tions, seems to think that although Julius Caesar did introduce Libra into the 
Roman calendar, still it might have been used by the Egyptians and other na-
tions before that time. He observes, that in the Arabian hemisphere the belt 
of Orion is designated by the beam of a balance, and one of the Lunar stations 
of the Hindoos bears the same appellation. "It cannot be denied," he con-
tinues, "that the figures of the Egyptian, Chaldean, and Grecian zodiacs were 
known in India from a period of unexplored antiquity, and it is probable that 
when Julius Caesar added the Balance to the Roman zodiac, he did it at the 
suggestion of Sosigenes, a native of Egypt, who could not have been ignorant 
of the division of the ecliptic used in the East." There appears to us no force 
in these remarks. The Romans, we know, received from the Greeks and 
Egyptians the other signs of their zodiac, and if Libra then existed, why was it 
not added at the same time? Besides, we are assured that the most ancient 
Chaldean astronomers divided their zodiac into eleven signs only, making 
Libra a part of Scorpio.
Libra is the seventh sign in the ecliptic, and is marked by the following character, =*, which resembles the scale beam.
History.--The Greeks declare that the Balance was placed among the 
stars to perpetuate the memory of Mochus, the inventor of weights and mea-
sures. This story we think far more probable, than the accounts which they 
have transmitted to us of the origin of the other constellations.
In the Jewish calendar the Balance is allotted to the tribe of Asher. (Green, 81-2)</note>

                <note xml:id="SAGITTARIUSGLOSS" resp="#DCH">Sagittarius is depicted in the sky as a centaur, with the body and four legs of a
                    horse but the upper torso of a man. He is shown wearing a cloak and drawing
                    a bow, aimed in the direction of the neighbouring scorpion, Scorpius. Aratus
                    spoke of the Archer, Τοξότης (Toxotes), and his Bow, Τόξον (Toxon), as though
                    they were separate constellations. Most likely this is because the stars of the bow
                    and arrow are the most distinctive part of the figure. They form the asterism
                    that we now know as the Teapot (see below).
                    Sagittarius is a constellation of Sumerian origin that represented PA.BIL.SAG,
                    a god of war and hunting who they depicted as a centaur-like archer with wings.
                    The Sumerian figure was subsequently adopted by the Greeks, although without
                    the wings. As a result there are no particular myths associated with this constellation and the Greek mythographers were confused as to its identity.
                    Some doubted that this was a centaur at all, among them Eratosthenes who
                    gave as one of his reasons the fact that centaurs did not use bows. Instead,
                    Eratosthenes described Sagittarius as a two-legged creature with the tail of a
                    satyr. He said that this figure was Crotus, son of Eupheme, the nurse to the
                    Muses, who were nine daughters of Zeus. The Roman mythographer Hyginus
                    in his Fabulae added the information that his father was Pan, agreeing with
                    Eratosthenes that the archer was a satyr rather than a centaur.
                    Crotus was said to have invented archery and often went hunting on horseback. He lived on Mount Helicon among the Muses, who enjoyed his company.
                    They sang for him, and he applauded them loudly. The Muses requested that
                    Zeus place him among the stars, where he is seen demonstrating the art of
                    archery. In the sky he was given the hind legs of a horse because he was such a
                    keen horseman.
                    Aratus and Ptolemy, though, both spoke of the archer as four-legged, which
                    is how he is usually depicted. Ptolemy described him with a flowing cloak,
                    known as the ephaptis, attached at his shoulders. By his forefeet is a circle of
                    stars that Hyginus said was a wreath ‘thrown off as by one at play’. This circlet
                    of stars is the constellation Corona Australis (see page 80). Sagittarius was sometimes misidentified as Chiron, a wise and scholarly centaur, but Chiron is in fact
                    represented by the other celestial centaur, the constellation Centaurus.
                    Stars of Sagittarius
                    Alpha Sagittarii is called Rukbat, from the Arabic rukbat al-rami, ‘knee of the
                    archer’. Beta Sagittarii is called Arkab, from the Arabic name meaning ‘the archer’s Achilles tendon’. Gamma Sagittarii is Alnasl, from the Arabic meaning
                    ‘the point’, referring to the tip of the archer’s arrow.
                    Delta, Epsilon, and Lambda Sagittarii are respectively called Kaus Media,
                    Kaus Australis, and Kaus Borealis. The word Kaus comes from the Arabic
                    al-qaus, ‘the bow’, while the suffixes are Latin words signifying the middle,
                    southern, and northern parts of the bow. Zeta Sagittarii is Ascella, a Latin word
                    meaning ‘armpit’. All these names closely follow the descriptions of the stars’
                    positions given by Ptolemy in his Almagest.
                    Last, but not least, is Sigma Sagittarii, called Nunki. This name was applied
                    relatively recently by navigators, but it was borrowed from a list of Babylonian
                    star names. The Babylonian name NUN-KI was given to a group of stars representing their sacred city of Eridu on the Euphrates. The name is now applied
                    to Sigma Sagittarii alone, and is reputedly the oldest star name in use.
                    Ptolemy in the Almagest inexplicably classified the stars that we know as Alpha
                    and Beta Sagittarii as second magnitude, when they are in fact fourth. Bayer, who lived too far north to see these stars for himself, accepted Ptolemy’s assess -
                    ment and labelled them Alpha and Beta. In fact, Alpha Sagittarii is only the
                    15th brightest star in the constellation, over seven times fainter than the brightest
                    star, Epsilon, which is magnitude 1.8.
                    Tea, with milk
                    Among present-day astronomers, the shape outlined by the eight main stars of
                    Sagittarius (Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Lambda, Phi, Sigma, Tau, and Zeta) is
                    popularly known as the Teapot. Its handle consists of Phi, Sigma, Tau, and
                    Zeta, the top of the lid is marked by Lambda, while Delta, Epsilon, and Gamma
                    are the triangu lar spout. This same group of stars, with the addition of Mu
                    Sagittarii, was originally visualized as the archer’s bow and arrow. A subset of
                    these stars – Lambda, Phi, Sigma, Tau, and Zeta – form a ladle shape called
                    the Milk Dipper, fittingly placed in a rich area of the Milky Way.
                    Sagittarius contains dense Milky Way star fields that lie towards the centre
                    of our Galaxy. The exact centre of the Galaxy is believed to be marked by a
                    radio-emitting source that astronomers call Sagittarius A, near the border with
                    Ophiuchus and close to the point of the archer’s arrow. There are many notable
                    objects in Sagittarius, including the Lagoon Nebula and the Trifid Nebula, two
                    much-photographed clouds of gas lit up by stars inside them. (Ridpath, 154-6)

This sign is quite low in the south. The Milky Way passes through the 
Bow and Arrow of Sagittarius. Epsilon, Delta and Lambda are in the Bow, 
and Gamma and Sigma in the Arrow. Zeta, a star of the third magnitude, 
marks the string of the Bow. As this well defined cluster is directly west of 
Antares, it cannot be mistaken. A line drawn from Sigma to the bright star 
in Aquila, will pass through the head of Sagittarius, the outline of which in-
cludes three stars of the fourth magnitude, in a triangular form. Around the 
Bow of Sagittarius the Milky Way is remarkably luminous, and by the aid of a 
telescope, we may there discover, as well as in the body of the Archer himself 
a number of nebulse and little clusters of minute stars.
Sagittarius is bounded by Antinous, Scutum Sobiesci, Ophiuchus, Scorpio. 
Tubus Astronomicus, Corona Australis, Indus et Pavo, Microscopium, and Ca-
pricornus.
It is said that Sagittarius is represented on the Indian zodiacs just as the 
Greeks have copied the figure, which they have transmitted to us. At Den-
dera he is drawn with wings, and with two heads, one of a man which looks 
forwards, and one of a beast in a reversed position.
Sagittarius is the ninth sign in the order of zodiacal constellations, and is 
represented by an arrow or dart, thus /.
History.--The stars in this sign are enclosed in the outlines of a centaur, 
or an animal which is half man and half horse, a figure which was no doubt 
first suggested by seeing a man at a distance on horseback. According to 
some mythologists, this centaur is in memory of Chiron, the son of Saturn, 
who first taught men horsemanship. He also excelled in the science of astro-
nomy, and was greatly skilled in the healing art. His death was occasioned 
by a wound from an arrow dipped in the blood of the Lermean hydra. Others 
say that Sagittarius commemorates a famous hunter by the name of Crotus. 
We are pretty sure that this sign was originally intended as a symbol of the 
hunting season in the fall of the year.
Sagittarius is assigned in the Hebrew zodiac to the half tribe of Manasseh. (Green, 84-5)</note>

                <note xml:id="CANCERGLOSS" resp="#DCH">The crab is a minor character in one of the greatest epics of Greek myth: the
                    labours of Heracles (the Greek name for Hercules). While Heracles was fighting
                    the multi-headed monster called the Hydra in the swamp near Lerna, the crab
                    emerged from the swamp and added its own attack by biting Heracles on the
                    foot. Heracles angrily stamped on the crab, crushing it. For this modest contribution to history, we are told that the goddess Hera, the enemy of Heracles,
                    put the crab among the stars of the zodiac. Its name in Greek was Καρκίνος
                    (Karkinos), or Carcinus in Latin transliteration.
                    Fittingly enough for such a minor character it is the faintest of the zodiacal
                    constellations, with no star brighter than fourth magnitude. The star Alpha
                    Cancri is named Acubens, from the Arabic meaning ‘claw’. As described by
                    Ptolemy in the Almagest, this star lies on the southern claw of the crab; the northern claw is marked by Iota Cancri. Beta and Mu Cancri lie on the southern
                    and northern rear legs, respectively The asses and the manger
                    Gamma and Delta Cancri were known to the Greeks as Ὄνοι (Onoi), the asses;
                    we know them by their Latin names, Asellus Borealis and Asellus Australis, the
                    northern ass and southern ass, and they have their own legend. According to
                    Eratosthenes, during the battle between the gods and the Giants which followed
                    the overthrow of the Titans, the gods Dionysus, Hephaestus, and some companions came riding on donkeys to join the fray. The Giants had never heard
                    the braying of donkeys before and took flight at the noise, thinking that some
                    dreadful monster was about to be unleashed upon them. Dionysus put the asses
                    in the sky, either side of the cluster of stars which the Greeks called Φάτνη
                    (Phatne), the manger, from which the asses seem to be feeding. Ptolemy
                    described Phatne as ‘the nebulous mass in the chest’. Astronomers now know
                    this star cluster by its Latin name Praesepe, but it is popularly termed the
                    Beehive – praesepe can mean both ‘manger’ and ‘hive’.
                    The constellation gives its name to the tropic of Cancer, the latitude on Earth
                    at which the Sun appears overhead at noon on the summer solstice, June 21. In
                    ancient Greek times the Sun lay among the stars of Cancer on this date, but the
                    wobble of the Earth on its axis called precession has since moved the summer
                    solstice from Cancer through neighbouring Gemini and into Taurus (Ridpath, 57-8)

This sign contains no star larger than the fourth magni-
tude. A line drawn from Capella, through Beta in the head of Gemini, will 
show us Alpha in the southern claw. Another line drawn from Aldebaran, 
through Gamma in the feet of Gemini, will also point out this star. A line 
drawn through Alpha and Beta in Gemini, very nearly cuts the Stall or Man-
ger, a group of small stars of the sixth magnitude on the back of the Crab, 
sometimes called the nebulus of Cancer. Two stars of the fourth magnitude, 
marked Theta and Gamma, one to the north and the other to the south of the 
Manger, may readily be seen: the first is called the Northern Asellus, and the 
other the Southern Asellus. Delta, on the meridian, forms a pretty good right-
angled triangle with Theta and Gamma. Other small stars in the claws of the 
Crab, may be found with some difficulty. On the whole, Cancer is no very 
striking group. Near the star Alpha there is an oblong cluster of stars on a 
nebulous ground.
Cancer is bounded by Lynx, Gemini, Canis Minor, Hydra, and Leo.
In the zodiac of Dendera, and in most of the astrological remains of 
Egypt, a scarabseus or beetle is used as the symbol of this sign; but in Sir 
William Jones's oriental zodiac, and in some others found in India, we meet 
with the figure of a Crab. As the Hindoos in all probability derived their 
knowledge of the stars from the Chaldeans, we suppose the figure of the Crab 
in this place to be more ancient than that of the Beetle.
Cancer is the fourth sign in the zodiac, and is marked in astronomical 
books by the number 69 turned sideways, thus, ss. The original hieroglyphic 
figure for this sign is probably lost, as it no doubt bore some analogy to the 
outline of a crab or a beetle.
History.--Many different accounts have been given by the mythologists 
of the origin of this constellation. The most current opinion is, that it is in 
memory of the animal sent by Juno to annoy Hercules during his combat 
with the Lermean hydra. In some eastern representations of this sign, two 
animals like asses are found in this place; and as the Chaldaic name for the 
ass may be translated muddiness, it is supposed to allude to the discolouring 
of the Nile, which was rising when the sun entered Cancer. The Greeks, in 
copying this sign, have placed two asses in it, where they still remain; but 
they explain their reason for doing so, by saying that these are the animals 
which assisted Jupiter in his victory over the giants. (Green, 74-5)</note>

                <note xml:id="GEMINIGLOSS" resp="#DCH">Gemini represents the mythical Greek twins Kastor (Κάστωρ) and Polydeukes
                    (Πολυδεύκης). The Latinized forms of their names are Castor and Pollux (sometimes Polydeuces), by which they are now generally known. The Greeks referred
                    to them jointly as the Dioskouroi (Dioscuri in Latin), literally meaning ‘sons of
                    Zeus’. However, mythologists disputed whether both really were sons of Zeus,
                    because of the unusual circumstances of their birth. Their mother was Leda,
                    Queen of Sparta, whom Zeus visited one day in the form of a swan (represented by the constellation Cygnus). That same night she also slept with her
                    husband, King Tyndareus. Both unions were fruitful, for Leda subsequently
                    gave birth to four children. In the most commonly accepted version, Pollux and
                    Helen (later to become famous as Helen of Troy) were children of Zeus, and
                    hence immortal, while Castor and Clytemnestra were fathered by Tyndareus,
                    and hence were mortal.
                    Castor and Pollux grew up the closest of friends, never quarrelling or acting
                    without consulting each other. They were said to look alike and even to dress
                    alike, as identical twins often do. Castor was a famed horseman and warrior
                    who taught Heracles to fence, while Pollux was a champion boxer.
                    The inseparable twins joined the expedition of Jason and the Argonauts
                    in search of the golden fleece. The boxing skills of Pollux came in use when
                    the Argonauts landed in a region of Asia Minor ruled by Amycus, a son of Poseidon. Amycus, the world’s greatest bully, would not allow visitors to leave
                    until they had fought him in a boxing match, which he invariably won. He
                    stamped down to the shore where the Argo lay and challenged the crew to put
                    up a man against him. Pollux, stirred by the man’s arrogance, accepted at once
                    and the two pulled on leather gloves. Pollux easily avoided the rushes of his
                    opponent, like a matador side-stepping a charging bull, and felled Amycus with
                    a blow to the head that splintered his skull.
                    On the Argonauts’ homeward trip with the golden fleece Castor and Pollux
                    were of further value to the crew. Apollonius Rhodius tells us briefly that during
                    the voyage from the mouth of the Rhone to the Stoechades Islands (the presentday Iles d’Hyères off Toulon) the Argonauts owed their safety to Castor and
                    Pollux. Presumably a storm was involved, but he does not elaborate on the
                    circumstances. Ever since this episode, says Apollonius – and he assures us there
                    were other voyages on which they were saviours – the twins have been the
                    patron saints of sailors. Hyginus said that the twins were given the power to save shipwrecked sailors by Poseidon, the sea god, who also presented them with the
                    white horses that they often rode.
                    Mariners believed that during storms at sea the twins appeared in a ship’s
                    rigging in the form of the electrical phenomenon known as St Elmo’s fire,
                    as described by Pliny, the first-century Roman writer, in his book Natural History:
                    On a voyage stars alight on the yards and other parts of the ship. If there
                    are two of them, they denote safety and portend a successful voyage. For
                    this reason they are called Castor and Pollux, and people pray to them as
                    gods for aid at sea.
                    A single glow was called Helena and was considered a sign of disaster.
                    Castor and Pollux clashed with another pair of twins, Idas and Lynceus, over
                    two beautiful women. Idas and Lynceus (who were also members of the Argo’s
                    crew) were engaged to Phoebe and Hilaira, but Castor and Pollux carried them
                    off. Idas and Lynceus gave pursuit and the two sets of twins fought it out. Castor
                    was run through by a sword thrust from Lynceus, whereupon Pollux killed him.
                    Idas attacked Pollux but was repulsed by a thunderbolt from Zeus.
                    Another story says that the two pairs of twins made up their quarrel over the
                    women, but came to blows over the division of some cattle they had jointly
                    rustled. Whatever the case, Pollux grieved for his fallen brother and asked
                    Zeus that the two should share immortality. Zeus placed them both in the sky
                    as the constellation Gemini, where they are seen in close embrace, inseparable
                    to the last.
                    The two brightest stars in the constellation, marking the heads of the twins,
                    are named Castor and Pollux. Astronomers have found that Castor is actually
                    a complex system of six stars linked by gravity, although to the eye they appear
                    as one. Pollux is an orange giant star. Although Castor is labelled Alpha
                    Geminorum, it is actually fainter than Pollux, which is Beta Geminorum. Unlike
                    the twins that they represent, the stars Castor and Pollux are not related since
                    they lie at different distances from us, 52 and 34 light years respectively. Eta
                    Geminorum is called Propus, from the Greek πρόπους (propous) meaning
                    ‘forward foot’, a name that first appears with Eratosthenes; it arises from the
                    star’s position in the left (leading) foot of the advance twin, Castor.
                    Another identification – Apollo and Heracles
                    Aratus referred to the constellation only as the twins (Δίδυμοι, i.e. Didymoi),
                    without identifying who they were, but a century later Eratosthenes named them
                    as the Dioskouroi, in reference to Castor and Pollux. An alternative view,
                    reported by Hyginus, says that the constellation represents Apollo and Heracles
                    (i.e. Hercules), both sons of Zeus but not twins. Ptolemy called the constellation
                    the Twins (Δίδυμοι) in the Almagest, but in a later, more obscure treatise about
                    astrology, called Tetrabiblos, he referred to Castor as ‘the star of Apollo’ and
                    Pollux as ‘the star of Heracles’, supporting the identifications given by Hyginus.
                    Several star charts personify the twins as Apollo and Heracles. On the illustration from John Flamsteed’s atlas shown here, for example, one twin is
                    depicted holding a lyre and arrow, attributes of Apollo, while the other carries
                    a club, as did Heracles. Bode’s Uranographia depicts them in the same way. (Ridpath, 97-99)

Two stars of the second magnitude, marked Alpha and 
Beta, determine the heads of Gemini. Alpha, the most northern star of the 
two, is in the head of Castor, and may be found by considering Capella the ver-
tex of an isosceles triangle, whose base is toward the south. Aldebaran con-
stitutes the second angle of this triangle, and Castor the third. Beta or Pollux, 
which is obliquely below Castor, and about four degrees from it, cannot be 
mistaken. The stars in the feet of Gemini are nearly in a straight line, and 
almost parallel to those in the head. Gamma, the principal star in this line, 
may be found by drawing a line from Eta, through Gamma of the Great Bear. 
Zi is south of Gamma, and Nu and Mu to the north of it. Eta is a little below 
Mu. A line drawn from Beta in the head of Pollux, to Gamma in his foot, 
will give Delta in the body and Zeta in the knee. Delta is on the ecliptic. A 
line drawn from Alpha in the head of Castor, to Mu in his foot, will give Epsi-
lon in his knee. Gamma, Nu, Epsilon and Zeta, form a very regular four-
sided figure. Kappa and Iota in the shoulders, and Theta in the northern arm 
of Castor, are on a line with Capella. Other stars in Gemini may be found by 
referring from the plate to the heavens. A small star, marked H on the charts, 
near to Eta and just before the foot of Castor, is called Propus. This star 
served for many years to determine the position of the planet Herschell. The 
Milky Way passes through the feet of Gemini. There are two nebulae in this 
group. The star Epsilon appears double.
Gemini is bounded by Lynx, Telescopium Herschelii, Auriga, Orion, Mo-
noceros, Canis Minor, and Cancer.
Gemini is the third sign in the zodiac, and is represented by the following 
character, n; a very apt hieroglyphic of the union of two bodies.
On one of the zodiacs found in Egypt the Twins are represented by two 
sitting figures, with their arms extended; their heads are covered, which is an 
emblem denoting both dignity and power. This sign, on both the zodiacs of 
Dendera, is represented by a man and woman in a walking attitude, with this 
remarkable difference, however, the female figure on the zodiac in the portico 
has the head of one of the inferior animals, most probably that of a dog, in re-
ference to Anubis, or the planet Mercury typified by Anubis. On the oriental 
zodiac of Sir William Jones, we have Gemini represented by a boy and a girl 
embracing. Many other varieties in the ancient delineations of this sign might 
be noticed. They all agree in portraying two individuals united by the bonds 
of natural affection.
History.--There is great diversity of opinion among ancient authors re-
specting this constellation. Some say that it is Apollo and Hercules, and others 
Triptolemus and Jasion; but the most probable supposition is, it was intended 
by the Greeks in honour of Castor and Pollux, two sons of Jupiter. Accord-
ing to the fable, after the death of Castor, his brother, who was immortal, en-
treated his father, either to restore him to life, or else to deprive him of exist-
ence. This request was refused by Jupiter, but he permitted Castor to share 
equally in the life of his brother, or that they should live and die alternately 
every day. This decree was gladly accepted by Pollux, and consequently as 
long as one was on the earth the other was in the regions of the dead. From 
what we have already said, it will be seen that the Greeks can lay no just claim 
to the invention of this sign. They must have copied it from the Egyptian, or 
perhaps the Indian, representation of this group.
In the Hebrew zodiac, the Twins are referred to the tribe of Benjamin. (Green, 70-2)</note>

                <note xml:id="LYRAGLOSS" resp="#DCH">A compact but prominent constellation, marked by the fifth-brightest star in the
                    sky, Vega. Mythologically, Lyra (Λύρα in Greek) was the lyre of the great
                    musician Orpheus, whose venture into the Underworld is one of the most
                    famous of Greek stories. It was the first lyre ever made, having been invented
                    by Hermes, the son of Zeus and Maia (one of the Pleiades). Hermes fashioned
                    the lyre from the shell of a tortoise that he found browsing outside his cave on
                    Mount Cyllene in Arcadia. Hermes cleaned out the shell, pierced its rim and
                    tied across it seven strings of cow gut, the same as the number of the Pleiades.
                    He also invented the plectrum with which to play the instrument.
                    The lyre got Hermes out of trouble after a youthful exploit in which he stole
                    some of Apollo’s cattle. Apollo angrily came to demand their return, but when
                    he heard the beautiful music of the lyre he let Hermes keep the cattle and took
                    the lyre in exchange. Eratosthenes says that Apollo later gave the lyre to
                    Orpheus to accompany his songs.
                    Orpheus was the greatest musician of his age, able to charm rocks and
                    streams with the magic of his songs. He was even reputed to have attracted rows
                    of oak trees down to the coast of Thrace with the music of his lyre. Orpheus joined the expedition of Jason and the Argonauts in search of the golden fleece.
                    When the Argonauts heard the tempting song of the Sirens, sea nymphs who
                    had lured generations of sailors to destruction, Orpheus sang a counter melody
                    that drowned the Sirens’ voices.
                    Orpheus and Eurydice
                    Later, Orpheus married the nymph Eurydice. One day, Eurydice was spied by
                    Aristaeus, a son of Apollo, who attacked her in a fit of passion. Fleeing from
                    him, she stepped on a snake and died from its poisonous bite. Orpheus was
                    heartbroken; unable to live without his young wife, Orpheus descended into the
                    Underworld to plead for her release. Such a request was unprecedented. But
                    the sound of his music charmed even the cold heart of Hades, god of the
                    Underworld, who finally agreed to let Eurydice accompany Orpheus back to the land of the living on one solemn condition: Orpheus must not at any stage
                    look behind him until the couple were safely back in daylight.
                    Orpheus readily accepted, and led Eurydice through the dark passage that
                    led to the upper world, strumming his lyre to guide her. It was an unnerving
                    feeling to be followed by a ghost. He could never be quite sure that his beloved
                    was following, but he dared not look back. Eventually, as they approached the
                    surface, his nerve gave out. He turned around to confirm that Eurydice was still
                    there – and at that moment she slipped back into the depths of the Underworld,
                    out of his grasp for ever.
                    Orpheus was inconsolable. Thereafter he wandered the countryside, plaintively playing his lyre. Many women offered themselves to the great musician in
                    marriage, but he preferred the company of young boys.
                    The death of Orpheus
                    There are two accounts of the death of Orpheus. One version, told by Ovid in
                    his Metamorphoses, says that the local women, offended at being rejected by
                    Orpheus, ganged up on him as he sat singing one day. They began to throw
                    rocks and spears at him. At first his music charmed the weapons so that they fell
                    harmlessly at his feet, but the women raised such a din that they eventually
                    drowned the magic music and the missiles found their mark.
                    Eratosthenes, on the other hand, says that Orpheus incurred the wrath of
                    the god Dionysus by not making sacrifices to him. Orpheus regarded Apollo,
                    the Sun god, as the supreme deity and would often sit on the summit of Mount
                    Pangaeum awaiting dawn so that he could be the first to salute the Sun with
                    his melodies. In retribution for this snub, Dionysus sent his manic followers to
                    tear Orpheus limb from limb. Either way, Orpheus finally joined his beloved
                    Eurydice in the Underworld, while the muses put the lyre among the stars with
                    the approval of Zeus, their father.
                    Vega and other stars
                    Ptolemy knew the constellation’s brightest star simply as Λύρα (Lyra), the same
                    name as the constellation. The name we use for this star today, Vega, comes
                    from the Arabic words al-nasr al-waqi’ which can mean either ‘the swooping
                    eagle’ or ‘vulture’, for the Arabs saw both an eagle and a vulture here. The
                    constellation was often depicted on star maps as a bird positioned behind a lyre,
                    as in the illustration on the previous page. It seems that the Arabs visualized
                    Vega and its two nearby stars Epsilon and Zeta Lyrae as an eagle with folded
                    wings, swooping down in its prey, whereas in the nearby constellation Aquila
                    the star Altair and its two attendant stars gave the impression of a flying eagle
                    with wings outstretched. Vega is 25 light years away.
                    Beta Lyrae is called Sheliak, a name that comes from the Arabic for ‘harp’,
                    in reference to the constellation as a whole. Beta Lyrae is a celebrated variable
                    star. Gamma Lyrae is called Sulafat, from the Arabic meaning ‘the tortoise’,
                    after the animal from whose shell Hermes made the lyre. Between Beta and
                    Gamma Lyrae lies the Ring Nebula, often pictured in astronomy books; it is a
                    shell of gas like a celestial smoke ring, thrown off by a dying star. (Ridpath, 120-2)

This constellation lies in a southern direction from the 
head of Draco. A line drawn from Kochab to the head of Draco, and pro-
duced to about an equal distance, will give us Alpha or Wega, a beautiful star 
of the first magnitude in the Harp. Wega may also be known, as it forms the 
right angle of a large triangle with the Pole star and Arcturus, a bright star 
which we shall presently notice. Beta, Gamma and Delta are small but con-
spicuous stars, in the form of a triangle, a little to the south of Wega. Epsilon 
and Zeta, two small stars between Delta and Wega, form a triangle with Delta. 
These are on most maps put down as of the fifth magnitude: we have marked 
them of the fourth. In this cluster there is a fine nebula, which, if examined 
with a good telescope, appears of an oval form.
This group is bounded by Draco, Cygnus, Hercules, and Vulpecula et 
Anser.
History.--On some celestial maps this constellation is represented without 
the Vulture; but the bird is often seen, as we have figured it on our plate. 
This group is sometimes called the falling or descending Vulture, because it 
looks toward the south, and seems to be flying downwards, and Aquila, which 
is not far distant, has then the name of the ascending Vulture. This constella-
tion is supposed to be represented on some of the Egyptian obelisks as an em-
blem of spring. The Harp has had its place in the sky much longer than the 
Vulture. There is some difficulty in determining to what celebrated personage the 
Lyre or Harp, which is carried by the Vulture, belongs. The most pro-
bable conjecture seems to be, that it was intended to perpetuate the famous in-
strument with which Orpheus captivated the fair Eurydice. Such was the 
power of this instrument in the hand of Orpheus, that when he entered the 
regions of the dead in search of Eurydice, who was killed by the bite of a ser-
pent, that Pluto himself was charmed with its strains, the wheel of Ixion ceased 
to move, the stone of Sisyphus stood still, Tantalus forgot his thirst, the Furies 
themselves relented, and Proserpine consented to restore Eurydice to the re-
gions of day. (Green, 44-5)</note>

                <note xml:id="TRIANGULUMAUSTRALEGLOSS" resp="#DCH"><!--Green only has one entry for the Triangles.--> One of the 12 constellations introduced at the end of the 16th century by the
                    Dutch navigators Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, and the
                    smallest of them according to modern boundaries. A southern triangle had
                    previously been shown in a completely different position, south of Argo Navis,
                    on a globe of 1589 by the Dutchman Petrus Plancius, along with a southern
                    cross, but they were not the constellations we know today. The modern Triangulum Australe was first depicted in 1598 on a globe by Petrus Plancius and first
                    appeared in print in 1603 on the Uranometria atlas of Johann Bayer.
                    The three main stars of Triangulum Australe are brighter than those of
                    their northern counterpart, although the constellation is smaller. Navigators
                    have named its brightest star Atria, a contraction of its scientific name Alpha
                    Trianguli Australis.
                    On his 1756 planisphere of the southern stars the French astronomer Nicolas
                    Louis de Lacaille referred to it as ‘le Triangle Austral ou le Niveau’ (‘niveau’
                    meaning level) and he even showed it with an attached plumb bob, indicating
                    that he regarded it as representing a surveyor’s level. ‘Niveau’ was later Latinized to ‘libella’, as on Bode’s atlas shown here. Through some misreading, the historian R. H. Allen transferred the appellation ‘level’ to the nearby constellation
                    Norma and termed that constellation the Level and Square (instead of the Rule
                    and Square), thereby confusing generations of astronomers. (Ridpath, 169-70)</note>

                <note xml:id="CAPRICORNUSGLOSS" resp="#DCH">Capricornus is an unlikely looking creature, with the head and forelegs of a goat
                    and the tail of a fish. The constellation evidently originated with the Sumerians
                    and Babylonians, who had a fondness for amphibious creatures; the ancient
                    Sumerians called it SUHUR-MASH-HA, the goat-fish. But to the Greeks, who
                    named it Αἰγόκερως (Aigokeros, or Aegoceros in Latin transliteration), meaning
                    goat-horned, the constellation was identified with Pan, god of the countryside,
                    who had the horns and legs of a goat.
                    Pan, a playful creature of uncertain parentage, spent much of his time
                    chasing females or sleeping it off with a siesta. He could frighten people with
                    his loud shout, which is the origin of the word ‘panic’. One of his offspring was
                    Crotus, identified with the constellation Sagittarius. Pan’s attempted seduction of the nymph Syrinx failed when she turned herself into a handful of reeds. As
                    he clutched the reeds the wind blew through them, creating an enchanting
                    sound. Pan selected reeds of different lengths and stuck them together with wax
                    to form the famous pipes of Pan, also called the syrinx.
                    Pan came to the rescue of the gods on two separate occasions. During the
                    battle of the gods and the Titans, Pan blew a conch shell to help put the enemy
                    to flight. According to Eratosthenes his connection with the conch shell accounts
                    for his fishy nature in the sky, although Hyginus says somewhat absurdly that it
                    is because he hurled shellfish at the enemy. On a later occasion, Pan shouted a
                    warning to the gods that the monster Typhon was approaching, sent by Mother
                    Earth (Gaia) against the gods. At Pan’s suggestion the gods disguised themselves
                    as animals to elude the monster. Pan himself took refuge in a river, turning the
                    lower part of his body into a fish.
                    Zeus grappled with Typhon, but the monster pulled out the sinews from
                    Zeus’s hands and feet, leaving the god crippled. Hermes and Pan replaced the
                    sinews, allowing Zeus to resume his pursuit of Typhon. Zeus cut down the
                    monster with thunderbolts and finally buried him under Mount Etna in Sicily,
                    which still belches fire from the monster’s breath. In gratitude for these services,
                    Zeus placed the image of Pan in the sky as the constellation Capricornus.
                    The star Alpha Capricorni is called Algedi, from the Arabic al-jady meaning
                    ‘the kid’, the Arabic name for the constellation. Delta Capricorni is called Deneb
                    Algedi, from the Arabic for ‘the kid’s tail’. As defined by the modern IAU
                    boundaries Capricornus is the smallest of the 12 constellations of the zodiac,
                    occupying less than a third the area of the largest zodiacal constellation, Virgo.
                    The constellation gives its name to the tropic of Capricorn, the latitude on
                    Earth at which the Sun appears overhead at noon on the winter solstice, around
                    December 22. In Greek times the Sun was in Capricornus on this date, but as
                    a result of precession the Sun is now in Sagittarius at the winter solstice. (Ridpath, 65-6)

This sign is south of Delphinus and Antinous, and contains 
but a few remarkable stars. There are two in the head of the third magnitude, 
marked Alpha and Beta. Alpha, which is the most northern star, is double. 
They may both be found by drawing a line from Lyra to the bright star in 
Aquila, and then producing it in a southern direction. Two stars of the fourth 
magnitude, in the tail, may be known by drawing a line from Gamma in the 
middle of the Cross of Cygnus, through the quadrilateral figure in Equuleus.
Capricornus is bounded by Antinous, Sagittarius, Microscopium, Globus 
AErostaticus, and Aquarius.
In almost all the ancient zodiacs which have descended to us, we find 
the symbol which represents this sign very much the same. On some astro-
logical fragments the Goat is fastened by a cord to Anubis. On the oriental 
zodiac of Sir W. Jones, this group is represented by a fish swallowing an an-
telope. The Greeks lay no claim to the invention of this sign, but refer its 
origin to the Egyptians.
Capricorn is the tenth zodiacal constellation, and is represented by the 
following character >j, which is an outline of the head of a goat, with a crooked 
horn on the right side.
History.--Some mythologists say that Capricoruus represents the goat
Amalthea, which nourished Jupiter during his infancy; but as we have before s
tated, it is probable that that animal was placed in the arms of Auriga. Others 
explain by another fable, this singular representation of Capricorn, which is 
drawn having the fore part of a goat joined to the body and tail of a fish. On 
a certain occasion, it is said, Pan, with some other deities, were feasting near 
the banks of the Nile, when suddenly the giant Typhon appeared among them. 
This occasioned so much terror that they all changed themselves into different 
forms and fled in every direction. Pan, who was the guardian of hunters 
and shepherds, plunged into the river; that part of his body which was under 
the water assumed the form of a fish, and the other part that of a goat. Ju-
piter, in order to preserve the memory of this event, placed this fantastic ani-
mal among the stars.
In the Hebrew zodiac Capricornus alludes to Zebulon. (Green, 87-8)</note>

                <note xml:id="MILKYWAYGLOSS" resp="#DCH">The Milky Way is not, of course, a constellation, but a band of faint light crossing the sky, consisting of countless distant stars. Aratus wrote of the sky being
                    ‘cleft all around by a broad band’ which he called Γάλα (Gala, the Greek for
                    milk). Eratosthenes called it Κύκλος Γαλαξίας (Kýklos Galaxías), the circle of
                    milk. Ptolemy in the Almagest spelled the name γαλακτίας (galaktías).
                    The Roman writer Manilius compared the Milky Way to the luminous wake
                    of a ship. Ovid in his Metamorphoses described it as a road lined on either side
                    by the houses of distinguished gods – ‘the Palatine district of high heaven’, he
                    termed it. Along this road the gods supposedly travelled to the palace of Zeus.
                    Eratosthenes tells us that the Milky Way was the result of a trick played by
                    Zeus on his wife Hera so that she would suckle his illegitimate son Heracles and
                    hence make him immortal. Hermes laid the infant Heracles at Hera’s breast
                    while she was asleep, but when she woke and realized who the baby was –
                    perhaps by the strength with which he sucked – she pushed him away and her
                    milk squirted across the sky to form the Milky Way.
                    Manilius listed various explanations for the Milky Way that were current in
                    his day, both scientific and mythological. One suggestion was that it is the seam
                    where the two halves of the heavens are joined – or, conversely, where the two
                    halves are coming apart like a split in the ceiling, letting in light from beyond.
                    Alternatively, said Manilius, it might be a former path of the Sun, now covered
                    in ash where the sky was scorched. Some thought that it could mark the route
                    taken by Phaethon when he careered across the sky in the chariot of the Sun
                    god, Helios, setting the sky on fire (see Eridanus, pages 94–96). Yet again, noted
                    Manilius, it could be a mass of faint stars, an idea attributed to the Greek
                    philosopher Democritus of the fifth century BC, which we now know to be
                    correct. Finally, on a quasi-religious note, Manilius suggested that the Milky Way
                    could be the abode of the souls of heroes who had ascended to heaven.
                    In Chinese astronomy the Milky Way was Tianhe, the Celestial River, also
                    translatable as River of Heaven. Nine stars in Cygnus, including Deneb, represented Tianjin, a ford across the river at a point where it appeared to be
                    particularly shallow; the impression of shallowness comes about because a dark
                    cloud of dust in the local spiral arm of our Galaxy obscures part of the Milky
                    Way in this region.
                    To the Arabs of the Middle Ages the Milky Way was known as al-madjarra,
                    from a word meaning a place where something is pulled or drawn along, such
                    as a cart track. It seems that Arab scientists such as al-Bīrūnī (973–1048) understood the Milky Way’s true nature as a distant mass of stars, which was finally
                    confirmed by Galileo’s telescopic observations in 1610. (Ridpath, 184)

The Milky Way, or Galaxy as it is sometimes called, is certainly one of the 
most striking objects in the sky. When examined without the assistance of the 
telescope, it appears as a broad track or path, of a whitish colour, encompassing 
the heavens. Its form, its breadth, and its colour are various in different parts 
of its course; in some places it is dense and luminous, in others it is scattered 
and faint: its breadth is often not more than five degrees, and sometimes it is ten 
or sixteen. In some places it assumes a double path, but for the most part it is 
single. It may be traced in the heavens beginning near the head of Cepheus, 
about thirty degrees from the north pole, through the constellations Cassiopeia, 
Perseus, Auriga, and part of Orion and Gemini, where it crosses the Zodiac. 
In the southern hemisphere it takes in the Ship Argo, Charles's Oak, the Cross, 
the feet of the Centaur and the Altar. Here it divides into two branches, as it 
passes over the Zodiac again into the northern hemisphere. One branch runs 
through the tail of Scorpio, the bow of Sagittarius, the slucld of Sobieski, the 
feet of Antinous, Aquila, Delphinus, Sagitta, and the southern wing of Cygnus. 
The other branch passes through the upper part of the tail of Scorpio, the side 
of Serpentarius, Taurus Poniatovii, Anser, and the neck of Cygnus, where it 
unites with the other, and they then pass on to the head of Cepheus, where 
there is a small opening. There arc some traces of the same kind of light 
as that which is emitted from the Milky Way near the south pole, but they are 
small and faint.
Some ancient philosophers maintained that the Sun had once gone in this 
track before he entered the ecliptic, and that its whiteness proceeded from the 
remains of his light. The Poets had the odd fancy that the Galaxy was the 
path which their deities used in the heavens, and which led immediately to the 
abode of Jupiter. Milton alludes to this in the following lines: 
"A broad and ample road, whose dust is gold, 
And pavement stars, as stars to us appear 
Seen in the Galaxy." 
By the help of the telescope we now are able to demonstrate that this path or 
zone in the heavens, consists of an immense multitude of minute stars, seem-
ingly very close to each other, whose mingled light gives it the whitish tinge it 
usually assumes. Dr. Herschel considers it a stratum of nebulous matter, ana-
logous to that which appears in little spots in many other places, or that it is a 
continued assemblage of nebulae. The term nebula is applied to little specks 
which shine with a dim, hazy light. These are seldom distinguished with the 
naked eye, but if a good telescope be applied to them, they appear to be lumi-
nous spots of various figures, and may be resolved into little clusters of minute 
stars. The number of nebulae before the time of Herschel, was estimated at one hundred and 
three; but previous to April, 1784, he added four hundred and 
sixty to this list. Telescopes of a still greater power than the one he used would 
no doubt enable us to discover many more. Herschel has offered a bold and 
sublime theory on this subject. He supposes the starry heavens to be replete 
with these nebulae, and that each of them is a distinct and separate system, in-
dependent of the rest. The Milky Way he imagines to be that particular ne-
bula in which our Sun is placed, and from the numerous and accurate obser-
vations which he has made on nebulous appearances, he has certainly rendered his 
hypothesis very plausible. (Green, 19-20)</note>
