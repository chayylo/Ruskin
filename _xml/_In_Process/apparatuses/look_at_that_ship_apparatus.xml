                    <p>The MS XI fair copy was dated by Ruskin “febuary [sic] or march 1827”. On the reverse, another hand wrote 
                        “16 Feby 1827”; and adjoining this date, there appears an obscure notation, “[No.(?)] 6817”. 
                        In MS III, Ruskin situated another fair copy among poems composed almost a year later, for New Year's 1828 and afterward.</p>

                    <p>In the MS XI fair copy, Ruskin entitled the poem “look at that ship”. 
                        Im the MS III fair copy, Ruskin entitled the poem “THE SHIP”, 
                        and the imperative “Look at that ship” forms the first line of that version.</p>

                        which shares a similar, though not identical, set of first six lines with the present poem; thereafter, the later poem swerves in a quite different direction, 
                        so much so that the new poem must be treated as a related but separate composition, rather than as a version of the earlier poem.</p>

                    <p>What the speaker "looks at" when looking at the ship constitutes, in part, an observation about the apparent size of objects in relation to their distance. 
                        Ruskin drew this observation from a lesson in The History of Sandford and Merton by Thomas Day, 
                        in which the tutor, Mr. Barlow, instructs Tommy Merton to work out the relation of apparent size to distance 
                        by looking at ships at sea from than vantage of the shore. Tommy needs the lesson, having revealed the dependency of his thinking on appearances--his 
                        assumption that the stars revolve, rather than the earth in relation to them; and that the stars must be smaller than the sun, 
                        given tbeir relative appearance in the sky. Mr. Barlow takes advantage of a walk by the sea to correct Tommy's assumptions. 
                        Lexical borrowings from this passage in Ruskin's poem prove that he based his poem on this passage.
                        <!-- floating text -->
                        <p>they continued their excursion over the hills, till at last they came in sight of the sea.—As 
                            they were diverting themselves with the immense prospect of water that was before them, 
                            Mr. Barlow perceived something floating at a distance, so small as to be scarcely discernible by the eye. 
                            He pointed it out to Tommy, who with some difficulty was able to distinguish it, and asked him what he thought it was?</p>
                        <p>Tommy answered that he imagined it to be some little fishing boat; but could not well tell, on account of the distance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Barlow. If you do not then see a ship, what is it you do see, or what does that object appear to your eyes?</p>
                        <p>Tommy. All that I can see is no more than a little dusky speck, which seems to grow bigger and bigger.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Barlow. And what is the reason it grows bigger and bigger?</p>
                        <p>Tommy. Because it comes nearer and nearer to me.</p> 
                        <p>Mr. Barlow. What, then, does the same thing some times appear small, and sometimes great?</p>
                        <p>Tommy. Yes, sir, it seems small when it is at a great distance; for I have observed even houses and churches, 
                            when you are at some miles distant, seem to the eye very small indeed: and now I observe that the vessel is sailing towards us, 
                            and it is not, as I imagined, a little fishing boat, but a ship with a mast; for I begin to distinguish the sails.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Barlow walked on a little while by the side of the sea; and presently Tommy called out again: 
                            'I protest, I was mistaken again; for it is not a vessel with one mast, as I thought a little while ago, 
                            but a fine large ship, with three great masts, and all her sails before the wind. 
                            I believe she must either be a large merchant-mari or else a frigate'</p>
                        <p>Mr. Barlow. Will you then take notice of what you have now been saying? What was first only a little dusky speck 
                            became a vessel with one mast; and now this vessel with one mast plainly appears a ship of a very large size, 
                            with all her masts, and sails, and rigging complete. Yet all these three appearances are only the same object, 
                            at different distances from your eye.</p>
                        <p>Tommy. Yes, sir; that is all very true indeed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Barlow. Why, them, if the ship, which is now full in sight, were to tack about again, and sail away from us 
                            as fast as she approached just now; what do you think would happen?</p>
                        <p>Tommy. It would grow less and less every minute till it appeared a speck again.</p>
                        <p>(Day, History of Sandford and Merton, 200-202)</p>
