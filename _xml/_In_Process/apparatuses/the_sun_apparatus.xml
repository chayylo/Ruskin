                    <p>In MS XI, "The Sun" is printed by Ruskin in pencil as a presentation copy for New Year's 1828, followed on the same sheet by

                        as the fourth poem--the same sequence in which they are printed in the presentation copy. "The Sun" is preceded in the anthology by the New Year's poem for 1827, 
                        "Time: Blank Verse"; and both are preceded by the first poem in the anthology, "The Constellations".</p>

                        <p>With "mamma beside me" walking in the garden, Ruskin's praise condenses 
                            Adam and Eve's morning hymn in book 5 of Paradise Lost, "These are thy glorious works, Parent of good". 
                            Ruskin relies on Milton's organizing trope of the sun's course from dawn to noon to sunset, 
                            and he borrows some diction such as invoking the sun to "disperse" the night.
                            <!-- floating text -->
                            Thou Sun, of this great world both eye and soul,
                            Acknowledge him thy greater; sound his praise
                            In thy eternal course, both when thou climbest,
                            And when high noon hast gained, and when thou fallest.
                            Moon, that now meetest the orient sun, now flyest,
                            With the fixed Stars, fixed in their orb that flies;
                            And ye five other wandering Fires, that move
                            In mystic dance not without song, resound
                            His praise, who out of darkness called up light.
                            Air, and ye Elements, the eldest birth                                  180
                            Of Nature's womb, that in quaternion run
                            Perpetual circle, multiform; and mix
                            And nourish all things; let your ceaseless change
                            Vary to our great Maker still new praise.
                            Ye Mists and Exhalations, that now rise
                            From hill or steaming lake, dusky or gray,
                            Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,
                            In honour to the world's great Author rise;
                            Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky,
                            Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers,                          190
                            Rising or falling still advance his praise.
                            His praise, ye Winds, that from four quarters blow,
                            Breathe soft or loud; and, wave your tops, ye Pines,
                            With every plant, in sign of worship wave.
                            Fountains, and ye that warble, as ye flow,
                            Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.
                            Join voices, all ye living Souls:  Ye Birds,
                            That singing up to Heaven-gate ascend,
                            Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise.
                            Ye that in waters glide, and ye that walk                               200
                            The earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;
                            Witness if I be silent, morn or even,
                            To hill, or valley, fountain, or fresh shade,
                            Made vocal by my song, and taught his praise.
                            Hail, universal Lord, be bounteous still
                            To give us only good; and if the night
                            Have gathered aught of evil, or concealed,
                            Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark!
