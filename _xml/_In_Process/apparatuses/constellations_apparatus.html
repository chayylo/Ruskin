               <h2><span class="headingNumber">1.2. </span><span class="head">Title</span></h2>
               <p>In the earlier of two surviving fair copies of the poem (see <a class="link_ref" href="#MAJORMS" title="Manuscripts">Manuscripts</a>), <a class="link_ref" href="rft70_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">RF T70</span></a>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> centered <span class="titlem">“<span class="caps">THE CONSTELLATIONS</span>”</span> above the column of lines. Then, in what appears an afterthought, he added “<span class="caps">NORTHERN</span>” to the right in the margin, on the baseline of the main title; and on a second line
                  below “<span class="caps">NORTHERN</span>”, he placed, awkwardly, in the margin to the right of the opening lines of the poem,
                  “<span class="caps">SOME OF THE ZODIAC / AND SOME OF THE SOUTHERN</span>”. The added, trailing subtitle suggests that he extended the title as he expanded
                  the poem, perhaps indicating one reason why he gave up on this fair‐copy manuscript,
                  <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, and used the same sheet to revise some of its lines (see <span class="ref">Composition and Publication</span>).</p>
               <p>In the second surviving fair copy, in <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III</span></a>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> incorporated his revisions to the first fair copy, including allowing space to center
                  the subtitle properly below the main title and above the first line, breaking the
                  three lines as <span class="titlem">“<span class="caps">THE CONSTELLATIONS / NORTHERN, SOME OF THE ZODIAC AND / SOME OF THE SOUTHERN</span>”</span>.</p>
               <p>The fragment of draft of the poem, which is bound in <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span></a>, lacks a title. Since the (unnumbered) lines in this manuscript start with line 27
                  as fair‐copied, presumably a sheet containing draft of preceding lines has been lost,
                  which may have included a title. The first state of the title is unknown, therefore,
                  and we can only speculate how the subtitle may have reflected the method of composition
                  at that stage. See <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php#COLLATION"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span>: Collation of the Original Bound Manuscript</a>.</p>

                  <p>A fragmentary manuscript, <span class="titlem"><span class="titlem">“cepheus and bootes now”</span></span>, is a 12.5 × 20 cm vertically folded sheet, written on all four sides in pencil,
                     with some substitutions written in ink. Although unsigned, and the hand described
                     as “unidentifed” in the finding aid of the <span class="titlem">Beinecke Library John Ruskin Collection</span>, the hand is distinctly <span class="persName">John Ruskin</span>ʼs early cursive.</p>
                  <p>The manuscript probably was bound into into <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> by <span class="persName">Cook</span> and <span class="persName">Wedderburn</span>. Like the other contents of this miscellaneous collection, however, this item was
                     separated from its binding, whether prior to or as a result of <span class="persName">Charles Goodspeed</span>ʼs house fire. See <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php#COLLATION"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span>: Collation of the Original Manuscript</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php#COLLATION"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span>: Contents, <span style="font-style:italic">b</span></a>. Presently, at the <span class="placeName">Beinecke Library</span>, the manuscript is catalogued as part of the <span class="titlem">John Ruskin Collection, Series II: Manuscripts</span>, <span class="date">1826–1897</span>, subseries Unbound Manuscripts, “<span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Monastery</span></span>—Manuscript, in an unidentified hand, of passages of verse, undated”, along with a
                     fragment of draft of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, which is similar in appearance to the <span class="titlem">“Constellations”</span> draft.</p>

               <div class="subsection" id="MAJORMS-RFT70">
                  <h3><span class="headingNumber">1.4.2. </span><span class="head"><span class="titlem">RF T70</span></span></h3>
                  <p>A facsimile of a manuscript—the whereabouts of the original being unknown—this item
                     consists of two photographs, which document a verticqlly folded sheet containing a
                     fair copy of the poem in pen‐and‐ink print lettering in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs hand, along with revisions of the text in his cursive hand, both ink and pencil.
                     Possibly, the photographs were taken in the course of preparing the <a class="link_ref" href="library_edition_note.php"><span class="titlem">Library Edition</span></a>; if so, the facsimile was not cited or reproduced in the edition. The photographs
                     are held by <span class="orgName">The Ruskin</span> at <span class="orgName">Lancaster University</span>, catalogued as <a class="link_ref" href="rft70_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">RF T70</span></a>.</p>
                  <p>The folded sheet was photographed spread open and laid flat, with one photograph showing
                     pages 4 and 1 (from left to right), and the other photograph showing the reverse side,
                     pages 2 and 3 (from left to right). The manuscript reveals at least two major stages
                     of composition, a first stage of fair copying, and a second stage of heavy revision.
                     The fair copy occupies pages 1–2 (i.e., both sides of the first leaf), while originally
                     the remaining pages 3–4 (the second leaf) would have been left blank. Subsequently,
                     <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> used this blank space, as well as the margins of pages 1–2, for revisions. Thus,
                     the facsimiles preserve a rare instance of a manuscript containing a fair copy of
                     an early work by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> that he subsequently revised using the same sheet.</p>

                  <p>A second fair copy appears as the first poem in the <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_poetry_anthology_2_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III Second Poetry Anthology</span></a>, which is contained in <a class="link_ref" href="apparatus_msiii.php"><span class="titlem">MS III</span></a>.

                  <p>This fair copy incorporates <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs revisions to the first fair copy shown in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>.

               <p><span class="date">Not earlier than August 1827, not later than December 1828</span>; most likely the <span class="date">first quarter of 1828</span>.</p>
               <p>Neither the <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span></a> manuscript nor the <a class="link_ref" href="rft70_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">RF T70</span></a> manuscript is dated, and <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> assigned no date to the fair copy of the poem in the <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_poetry_anthology_2_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III Second Poetry Anthology</span></a> as he did to some other poems in that group.</p>
               <p><span class="persName">Cook</span> and <span class="persName">Wedderburn</span> ascribed the poem to <span class="date">1827</span>, and they cited as sources the <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span></a> and <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III</span></a> versions (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Works</span></span></a>, 2:535). No mention is made in the <a class="link_ref" href="library_edition_note.php"><span class="titlem">Library Edition</span></a> of the manuscript captured by the photographs, <a class="link_ref" href="rft70_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">RF T70</span></a>. Judging by the little the editors wrote about the poem, they based their dating
                  on an association of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> with a poem they declare contemporaneous, <a class="link_ref" href="monastery_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span></a>, although they leave the nature of this association unexplained (see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Works</span></span></a>, 2:260 n. 1). Their method is sound but their conclusion inexact.</p>
               <p>The physical basis of this association is the similarity of the fragments of rough
                  draft in a pencil, cursive hand—so similar that the two drafts were apparently mistaken
                  as belonging to the same work (see <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php#COLLATION"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span>: Collation of the Original Manuscript</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php#COLLATION"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span>: Contents, <span style="font-style:italic">b</span></a>). For the place of this draft in the chronological sequence of drafting, revising,
                  and fair‐copying <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB" title="Composition and Publication">Composition and Publication</a>. Here it suffices to explain that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs hand in these draft manuscripts, which is a sprawling cursive in pencil with occasional
                  substitutions in pen‐and‐ink cursive, cannot be earlier than his first use of pen
                  and ink in <span class="date">April 1827</span>; and that the compositional history of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, places its <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> draft fragment, which contains lines of book 2 of the poem, no earlier than <span class="date">August 1827</span> and possibly starting as late as <span class="date">November 1828</span>, following the familyʼs return to <span class="placeName">Herne Hill</span> from the <a class="link_ref" href="tours_of_1826-27_note.php"><span class="date">Tour of 1827</span></a> to <span class="placeName">Scotland</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="monastery_apparatus.php#DATE"><span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>: Date</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="monastery_apparatus.php#COMPPUB"><span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>: Composition and Publication</a>).</p>
               <p>As another physical feature besides the similarity of the <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> rough drafts linking <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> chronologically with the composition of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, the first fair copy of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> (<span class="titlem">RF T70</span>) shares orthographic eccentricities of punctuation with the fair copy of books 1–2
                  of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> (<span class="titlem">MS III</span>). For the first twenty lines of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, each line ends with punctuation, occasionally a colon or full‐stop period, but most
                  frequently a prominent comma formed to look like book print, with a dot and a curl.
                  After twenty lines of this observant punctuation, the marks abruptly stop. This pattern
                  is identical in the fair copy of book 1 and the first eighty lines of book 2 of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, in which almost every line of verse ends with a punctuation mark until the punctuation
                  gives out altogether. The pattern suggests that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> may have added the punctuation to these poems all at once, layering the marks over
                  top of the already fair‐copied text, only to grow tired of the exercise and quit.
                  Thereafter, in both fair copies, only an occasional punctuation mark internal to a
                  verse line appears—a comma or an apostrophe, which is regularly spaced along with
                  the surrounding characters, indicating that the mark was inserted in the course of
                  fair‐copying. Moreover, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs penmanship for the punctuation is similar in the two fair copies, with the marks
                  at the ends of lines of verse tending to float above the baseline.</p>
               <p>These practices contrast markedly with the very sparse punctuation in both the fragmentary
                  rough drafts of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> and <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> in <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> and with the fair‐copy <a class="link_ref" href="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“poetry discriptive”</span></a>. The poems in the latter collection exhibit, moreover, an awkward learnerʼs stage
                  of penmanship, including tracing in ink over top of characters formed initially with
                  pencil. These factors put distance between the <span class="date">1827</span> <span class="titlem">“poetry discriptive”</span> and the fair copies of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> and <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, which in the eccentricity of their punctuation resemble the usage in <a class="link_ref" href="eudosia_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Eudosia”</span></a> (<a class="link_ref" href="msiv_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS IV</span></a>), which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> dated <span class="date">28 September 1828</span> on its title page. While the significance of that date within the compositional history
                  of <span class="titlem">“Eudosia”</span> is obscure, the triangulation of that projectʼs punctuation practices with those
                  of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> and <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> appear to situate the latter two projects decisively in <span class="date">1828</span>.</p>
               <p>When in <span class="date">1828</span>? If <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> based the first lines of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> on actual observation of the sky (or perhaps a demonstration at one of the so‐called
                  Lenten astronomy lectures), the alignment of planets and constellations described
                  at the beginning of the poem would have been observable in <span class="date">April–May 1828</span>, and not at all observable in <span class="date">1827</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="#REAL-LIFE" title="Observations Actual and Poetic">Discussion: Observations Actual and Poetic</a>). This approximate dating would place draft and first fair‐copying of both <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> and books 1–2 of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> in the <span class="date">first quarter of 1828</span>—between the <a class="link_ref" href="tours_of_1826-27_note.php"><span class="date">Tour of 1827</span></a>, which had been delayed until late in the year, and the Tour of <span class="date">1828</span>, probably begun following <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="date">10 May</span> birthday but interrupted that same month by news of the death of <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs sister, <span class="persName">Jessie</span>.</p>
               <p>Composition and fair‐copying during the first months of <span class="date">1828</span> accord well with the placement of the second fair copy of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> entered in <span class="titlem">MS III</span> as the first poem in the <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_poetry_anthology_2_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III Second Poetry Anthology</span></a>, immediately following <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2”</span></a>. While fair‐copying of that anthology cannot be dated precisely, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> would not have waited long to make a fair copy incorporating the extensive revisions
                  to the first fair copy (see <a class="link_ref" href="COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY">Composition and Publication: First Fair Copy [<span class="titlem">RF T70</span>]</a>); and the poemʼs placement juxtaposed with the second volume of <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy”</span> <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> emphasizes a thematic connection between the poem and the prose tale, since <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Harry</span> gives <span class="persName">Lucy</span> a drawing of the constellation <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span> “as an introduction to astronomy” (p. 7). (This fair copy of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> also precedes a fair copy of <a class="link_ref" href="the_sun_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“The Sun”</span></a>, which was composed for <span class="date">New Yearʼs, 1 January 1828</span>.) That <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>sʼs writing appears to have progressed little by the time he composed and fair‐copied
                  <span class="titlem">“Eudosia”</span> several months later—the same kind of catalog poem on a grandiose scale, fair‐copied
                  with the same kind or orthographic eccentricities and even weirder punctuation—can
                  be attributed to a long period of family mourning for the death of his aunt. His father
                  would have been preoccupied at home and in <span class="placeName">Perth</span>, making arrangements for his sisterʼs estate and orphaned children.</p>
               <p>Remaining open to question is whether composition of the initial draft of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> could have begun as early as a date in <span class="date">1827</span>, as <span class="persName">Cook</span> and <span class="persName">Wedderburn</span> supposed. A factor that might argue for confining composition to the <span class="date">first quarter of 1828</span> is the possibility—admittedly open to question—that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> based his opening lines on planetariy observations that were visible in the sky over
                  <span class="placeName">London</span> only during those months, and not in <span class="date">1827</span>. Those details, which survive in the opening lines of the poem as fair‐copied, are
                  missing along with the first page(s) of draft from the <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> manuscript. Thus, a genesis of the <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> draft commencing, say, in <span class="date">the fourth quarter of 1827</span> cannot be ruled out</p>

               <p>From surviving documents, a clear chronology is established based on revisions of
                  one document being incorporated in the next. Strikethroughs and substitutions in the
                  <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> pencil draft are incorporated into the copytext of the fair copy shown in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>; and strikethroughs and substitutions in the latter are in turn incorporated into
                  copytext for the <span class="titlem">MS III</span> fair copy. This genetic history tracks a similar and roughly contemporaneous record
                  of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs development of the poem, <a class="link_ref" href="monastery_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span></a>, as witnessed in manuscripts likewise contained in <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> and <span class="titlem">MS III</span>. Only <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, however, includes a stage of composition in which a fair copy is sacrificed to further
                  revision.</p>
               <p>As a stage of development in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs compositional methods, <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> along with <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> represent a significant advance, which sprang from learning to use pen and ink in
                  <span class="date">April 1827</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="hand_note.php">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</a>). For the first time, we see preserved draft containing deletions, substitutions,
                  and insertions, both in pencil and in ink, most of them in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs hand. At least one of the interventions is in the hand of <span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span>, but this is limited to correcting a mistranscription from the preceding draft. <span class="persName">Margaret</span> proofread; she did not herself revise <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs text. She did censor, however, by marking text she deemed inappropriate in some
                  way. Thus, these states of text open a window onto <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs compositional process as an interaction with his audience, his parents—with his
                  mother acting as proofreader and, to a limited extent, as editor. Perhaps these states
                  of draft and fair copy were preserved for this reason, that they recorded a distinct
                  stage of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs learning to write as an interactive process.</p>
               <p><span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> is also significant for its scope. It is one among several projects of <span class="date">1828</span> which are marked by their ambition and length, including the versification of <span class="persName">Scott</span>ʼs novel, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Monastery</span></span>, and the “poem on the universe”, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Eudosia</span></span>. Of these three, only <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> reached a conclusion.</p>

                  <p>This pencil‐on‐paper manuscript in a cursive hand, <span class="titlem"><span class="titlem">“<span class="name">cepheus</span> and <span class="name">bootes</span> now”</span></span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="#MAJORMS-MSIA" title="MS IA">Manuscripts: <span class="titlem">MS IA</span></a>), begins at line 27 of the poem as fair‐copied in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, and from that point the text extends for 49 lines on all four sides of a vertically
                     folded sheet. The surviving text starts at the top of 1r of the manuscript, lacking
                     title or context, evidently in mid‐career of the poem. While nothing definitive can
                     be determined about whether this manuscript is missing a witness to the original beginning
                     of its text, or nothing can be proved about what that opening text was, it is likely
                     that the missing draft closely matched the text as fair‐copied in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, given the consistency of the proofreading marks from start to finish on that later
                     manuscript (see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY" title="First Fair Copy (RF T70)">First Fair Copy [<span class="titlem">RF T70</span>])</a>).</p>
                  <p>It is possible that the now missing, opening piece of the manuscript was originally
                     bound in <span class="titlem">MS IA</span>, which in its current state has been damaged and unbound, with possible losses of
                     contents. See <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php#CONTENTS"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span>: Contents, <span style="font-style:italic">b</span></a>).</p>

                     <h4><span class="headingNumber">1.6.1.1. </span><span class="head">Hand</span></h4>
                     <p>The hand is recognizably <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs cursive, identical to the cursive hand in his holograph <a class="link_ref" href="jr_to_jjr_1827-05_al_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem"><span class="date">May 1827</span> letter to his father</span></a>. The latter document—the earliest surviving example of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs use of pen and ink—is composed almost entirely in cursive using a pencil, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> exchanging the pencil for pen and ink only for the closing of the letter, which he
                        also wrote in cursive. He continued beyond the signature by appending two poems, still
                        using a pen but switching to print lettering. Similarly here, at the end of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> switches from pencil to pen and ink for a closing, “I end”, written in cursive. Perhaps
                        he reserved pen and ink for closings in these early cursive manuscripts because the
                        ink suggested to him a sense of finality.</p>
                     <p>In this draft version of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> also uses pen and ink for a few minor revisions, making substitutions in ink by striking
                        through pencil draft with a pen and writing the substituted word above. This usage,
                        too, may have suggested finality to him, in act of polishing the verse. Alternatively
                        or additionally—and one suspects this to be the case in the <span class="titlem"><span class="date">1827</span> letter</span>—<span class="persName">Ruskin</span> felt more at ease manually in dipping a pen to form the strokes of print letters
                        as compared with maintaining the flow of cursive. With respect to penmanship, then,
                        the constrained use of pen and ink in <span class="titlem"><span class="titlem">“<span class="name">cepheus</span> and <span class="name">bootes</span> now”</span></span> represents an earlier developmental stage, comparable to the <span class="titlem"><span class="date">1827</span> letter to his father</span>, whereas the first fair copy, <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, shows him using a pen to write longer phrases, but over top of the same phrases
                        in pencil.</p>

                     <h4><span class="headingNumber">1.6.1.2. </span><span class="head">Two Successive Endings</span></h4>
                     <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> appears to have ended the poem twice in draft. At the bottom of the inside recto
                        page of the folded sheet (2r), he wrote “end” in pencil, cursive; and on the same
                        line, to the left, he wrote “I end” in ink, also cursive—the ink <span style="font-style:italic">end</span> being presumably the second of the two, though the order cannot be distinguished
                        from the material evidence. This <span style="font-style:italic">finis</span> follows <span class="name">Capricornus (the Goat)</span>, the last‐listed of the constellations in all three manuscript versions (line 64
                        in the second fair copy, <span class="titlem">MS III</span>): “and the <span class="name">goat</span> that is formed in the arched sky“. In draft as well as fair copy, this line carries
                        lexical markers of closure—for one, by beginning the line uniquely with <span style="font-style:italic">and</span>, as if to say, <span style="font-style:italic">and finally</span>; and for another, by ending the line with a flourish supplied by the quaintly poetic
                        modifier <span style="font-style:italic">arched</span> (in sources of this poetic diction, see the contextual gloss for <span style="font-style:italic">arched sky</span> in the witnesses).</p>
                     <p>Another ending is found on the back of the folded sheet (2v), where <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> added nine lines beyond the ending at the foot of the preceding page (2r). Below
                        these nine addtional lines, on a separate line by itself, he again wrote “I end” in
                        pencil longhand; and to the right of that <span style="font-style:italic">finis</span>, he wrote “I end” in ink longhand. (Again, presumably the phrase written in ink was
                        subsequent to the pencil phrase, but the evidence is indeterminate.) These nine lines
                        form the peroration of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> as fair‐copied in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>.</p>
                     <p>As originally concluded, therefore, if the “I end” on 2r truly indicates an earlier
                        intention, <span class="titlem"><span class="titlem">“<span class="name">cepheus</span> and <span class="name">bootes</span> now”</span></span> represented a less ambitious work poetically, aiming solely at a catalogue of stars
                        without any summary reflection on its meaning. In this respect, the first version
                        of the poem resembles lists of constellations that could be found in print sources
                        on astronomy aimed specifically at children, such as <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">An Introduction to Astronomy Intended for Little Children</span></span> (<span class="date">1817</span>)</a> by <span class="persName">Mary Martha Sherwood</span> (<span class="date">1775–1851</span>), although even <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs lists include implicit commentary in the form of Bible verses (see <a class="link_ref" href="#DISCUSSION" title="Discussion">Discussion: Print Sources of Astronomical Education</a>). <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs chief original contribution to such elementary lists consists in his epithets describing
                        each constellation. The version of the poem ending with <span class="name">Capricornus</span> is an aesthetic, poetic exercise more than a religious or scientific one.</p>
                     <p>The version of the poem ending with the nine‐line peroration introduces a contest
                        between “history” and “virtue”. The meaning and implications of this contest give
                        <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> trouble, as he revises these concluding lines after having fair‐copied them in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY" title="First Fair Copy (RF T70)">Composition and Publication: First Fair Copy (<span class="titlem">RF T70</span>)</a>; and <a class="link_ref" href="#MYTHS" title="Knowledge versus Christian Faith The Problem of Mythology">Discussion: Knowledge versus Christian Faith</a>).</p>

                     <p>The physical appearance of this manuscript of draft for <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> strikingly resembles another item of draft that was probably once bound in <span class="titlem">MS IA</span>, some surviving draft for <a class="link_ref" href="monastery_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span></a>, which begins <span class="titlem"><span class="titlem">“now must we leave poor martin there”</span></span> (lines 29–62 of book 2 of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs versification of <span class="persName">Scott</span>ʼs novel, as fair—copied and numbered in <span class="titlem">MS III</span>). The two poemsʼ drafts resemble one another in the size and kind of paper used for
                        the physical document, and in the sprawling cursive hand used for the pencil draft.
                        A difference between the manuscripts is that <span class="titlem">“Monastery”</span> draft contains no substitutions, either in pencil or in pen and ink, as does <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> draft, in ink over top of the pencil. (See <a class="link_ref" href="#MAJORMS-MSIA" title="MS IA">Manuscripts: <span class="titlem">MS IA</span></a>; at the <span class="placeName">Beinecke Library</span>, the two manuscripts are now (mistakenly) catalogued together as “<span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Monastery</span></span>—Manuscript, in an unidentified hand, of passages of verse, undated”, in the subseries,
                        Unbound Manuscripts, of the <span class="titlem">John Ruskin Collection, Series II: Manuscripts</span>, <span class="date">1826–1897</span>.)</p>
                     <p>Another item of <span class="titlem">“Monastery”</span> draft, <span class="titlem"><span class="titlem">“come on good horse and let us see”</span></span>, which was definitely bound in <span class="titlem">MS IA</span>, and which contains lines 14–62 of book 3 of the poem as fair‐copied in <span class="titlem">MS III</span>, is written in a cursive hand, one portion in pencil and another in ink. The ink
                        cursive hand resembling that used for the revisions of the <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> version of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>. The physical evidence thus conforms to the probable dating of the <span class="titlem">“Monastery”</span> draft, which is approximately <span class="date">late 1827 through the first quarter or half of 1828</span> (with an additional stage of composition and fair‐copying of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> possibly extending into <span class="date">1828–29</span>; see <a class="link_ref" href="monastery_apparatus.php#COMPPUB"><span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>: Composition and Publication</a>).</p>

                     <p>The original fair‐copy text of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> shown in the photographs is print‐lettered using pen and ink, thus dating the manuscript
                        as no earlier than <span class="date">April–May 1827</span>, when <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> first adopted that medium, and probably later in that year, when he had gained more
                        facility. While the dimensions of the original manuscript shown in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> cannot be measured based on a photograph, the lettering appears to be smaller and
                        more uniform compared to the large, spiky, uneven pen‐and‐ink print lettering that
                        characterize <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs dateable first efforts, such as <a class="link_ref" href="spring_blank_verse_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Spring: Blank Verse”</span></a> and <a class="link_ref" href="wales_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Wales”</span></a> and some poems in the anthology <a class="link_ref" href="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“poetry discriptive”</span></a>; and in contrast to formation of characters for <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . .

                     <p>Physical similarities connect the first fair copy of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> with the fair copy of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, just as resemblances between the two poemsʼ drafts point to an associated process
                        of composition (see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB-EARLIEST-DRAFT-COMPARISON" title="Relation to Draft for The Monastery">Relation to Draft for <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span></a>). The treatment of text in books 1–2 of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> as fair—copied in <span class="titlem">MS III</span> has more in common with <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> as fair—copied in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> than it does either with the work that immediately precedes the <span class="titlem">“Monastery”</span> poem in <span class="titlem">MS III</span>—namely, the anthology <a class="link_ref" href="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“poetry discriptive”</span></a>, which dates from earlier in <span class="date">1827</span>—or with the continuing fair copy of books 3–4 of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, which is set apart from books 1–2 in <span class="titlem">MS III</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="monastery_apparatus.php#COMPPUB1"><span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>: Composition and Publication—Stage One of Composition</a>). For both <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, books 1–2, and the first fair copy of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> adopted a comparatively miniscule print‐lettering, more like a serif book type.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, in the <span class="titlem">“poetry discriptive”</span> poems from earlier in <span class="date">1827</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> avoided punctuation almost entirely, whereas punctuation does characterize the fair
                        copies of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> and <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, books 1–2. In both, moreover. the punctuation marks share eccentricities suggesting
                        a learner who has an uncertain grasp of the grammatical and rhetorical function of
                        punctuation but who is excited—at least initially—by the physical appearance of the
                        marks on the page. Almost every line of books 1–2 of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> is punctuated, regardless of grammatical or rhetorical need, and the marks are used
                        exclusively at the ends of lines. This obsessive but misinformed observance abruptly
                        ceases at book 2, line 80, at the top of page 79 of the <span class="titlem">MS III</span> fair copy. Just so, the end of every line of the <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> <span class="titlem">“Constellations”</span> fair copy is notched with a punctuation mark until line 20, where the practice abruptly
                        stops. Where used, the punctuation often seems arbitrary. While the full—stop periods
                        make grammatical sense in most instances, the commas, colons, and (most prominently
                        in <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>) an upside—down semicolon seem interchangeable in their rhetorical placement. Both
                        these fair copies give the impression that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> layered over the texts with bookish punctuation to convey the appearance of print,
                        without understanding the grammatical and rhetorical function of the marks. (Another
                        bookish touch in both manuscripts is the numbering of the lines by fives in the left
                        margin.) Finally, in both fair copies, the punctuation markup stops abruptly at an
                        arbitrary place, suggesting that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> grew tired of the exercise, ran out of time, or was informed about his erroneous
                        usage.</p>
                     <p>How much time divides these bookish treatments of the longer poems from the earlier
                        <span class="date">1827</span> lyric‐descriptive poems? <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, and <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, books 1–2, can be triangulated with a third fair copy, that of <a class="link_ref" href="eudosia_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Eudosia”</span></a>, which is dated by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> as <span class="date">28 September 1828</span>, although it is unknown whether that date refers to the beginning or the end of the
                        latter project. Here, too, are found the miniscule lettering, the punctuation ending
                        each line until it doesnʼt, and the line numbering on the left. The punctuation is
                        frequently bizarre, <span class="titlem">“Eudosia”</span> uniquely displaying a mark formed from two horizontal dots, like a colon on its side
                        or a two—point ellipsis. This mark does not appear in <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, where all the colons are right—side up, but the semicolons are upside—down, with
                        the comma atop the point.</p>
                     <p>Beyond the tell‐tale details that associate these three projects chronologically,
                        what unifies the works as genres is their ambition—a catalogue of the constellations,
                        a versification of a novel, and “a poem on the universe”. Inevitably left incomplete
                        in the latter two cases, the projects mark <span class="date">1828</span> as a year of confident wielding of the pen.  The ambition appears to have carried
                        throughout the year in spite of the Ruskinsʼ aborted spring <a class="link_ref" href="tour_of_1828_note.php">Tour of <span class="date">1828</span></a>, which was cut short by the death of <a class="link_ref" href="richardson_jessie_note.php"><span class="persName">Jessie Richardson</span></a> and the subsequent period of mourning. Of consequence for the Ruskin household in
                        this year was the resettlement of <span class="persName">Jessie</span>ʼs children, including the adoption of <a class="link_ref" href="richardson_mary_note.php"><span class="persName">Mary Richardson</span></a> into the <span class="placeName">Herne Hill</span> daily life.</p>

                     <h4><span class="headingNumber">1.6.2.3. </span><span class="head">Margaret Ruskinʼs Role in the Fair‐Copying Process</span></h4>
                     <p>An especially valuable feature of the <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> fair copy is the evidence of <span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span>ʼs participation in its process. At line 54 of the poem, <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs handwriting can be unmistakably identified. The intervention is a penciled correction
                        of a mistranscription of a word from the draft text, substituting the word “bear”
                        for <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs erroneously copied “appear”. The insertion is accompanied by a penciled deletion
                        of “appear” using a style of strikethrough that differs from all other instances of
                        strikethrough, save one at line 30 (see the textual gloss hanging from line 54, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#MONOCEROSGLOSS">“The horn the <span class="name">unicorn</span> doth appear”</a>). From this evidence, one may infer that a series of other pencil marks on the manuscript—a
                        diagonal or double diagonal line at the end of each line of verse—records <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs proofreading of the fair copy against the draft manuscript. That these diagonal
                        marks were <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs is substantiated by their replacement by × marks next to certain lines of verse,
                        which evidently signaled her concerns, prompting revisions by <span class="persName">John</span>. It is possible that the marks were made by <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span>, but his handwriting does not otherwise appear in the manuscript.</p>
                     <p>While we can only infer <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs objections based on the content of the original verse and on <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs substitution, the topics that drew her censorship seem evident enough. The constellation
                        <span class="name">Medusaʼs Head</span> must have seemed too horrible, so it was replaced by the modern wonder of the <span class="name">Telescope</span>, a constellation that also advantageously sponsored patriotism for its assocation
                        with the British astronomer <span class="persName">William Herschel</span> (<span class="date">1738–1822</span>). Even the <span class="name">“furious lynx”</span> needed to be tamed to become only “keen‐eyed”. The religious associations with the
                        constellation, the <span class="name">Altar</span>, were dangerously pagan, so the epithet “gods fire” was added to lend a Biblical
                        context. One change was demanded apparently to prevent a jest from disturbing the
                        gravity of the subject; and some lines seem to have been assigned an × for no discernible
                        reason other than poetic: the trite and redundant epithet “pretty” was rejected, and
                        an imperfect rhyme needed mending  (see textual and contextual glosses hanging from
                        line 14, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#TELESCOPIUMGLOSS">“Then the dread medusas head”</a>; line 30, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_textual.php#LYNXTEXTGLOSS">“After that the furious <span class="name">lynx</span>”</a>; line 44, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_textual.php#GODSFIREGLOSS">“Next to it the <span class="name">altar</span>”</a>; lines 17 and 64, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_textual.php#LEPUSTEXTGLOSS">“After that doth come the <span class="name">lyre</span>” and “I wish I had not observed the <span class="name">lyre</span>”</a>; lines 12 and 40, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_textual.php#CYGNUSTEXTGLOSS">“Then the very pretty <span class="name">swan</span>”</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_textual.php#GRUSTEXTGLOSS">“Next the very pretty <span class="name">crane</span>”</a>; lines 41 and 42, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_textual.php#DOWNTEXTGLOSS">“<span class="name">Antinous</span> and <span class="name">arrow</span> soon” and “After it the <span class="name">southern crown</span>”</a>).</p>
                     <p>Each of the lines marked with an × resulted in a revision in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs hand. In most cases, he drafted the revision in the margin adjacent to the line,
                        first writing in cursive with a pencil, and then in some cases writing in cursive
                        with pen and ink to revise the revision over top of the pencil. Insofar as the available
                        evidence shows, then, the revisions were invented by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>; no other hand is present in the draft revision, although of course we cannot know
                        what discussion, if any, surrounded his decisions. We also cannot know for certain
                        at what point in the fair‐copying the process of proofreading and marking for revision
                        began. Since the poem is fair‐copied through the end of the extant <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> draft, it is reasonable to conclude that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> completed the fair‐copying before it was subjected to scrutiny, although some finishing
                        touches are incomplete: the marginal line numbering halts after line 60, with fifteen
                        remaining lines left unnumbered; and as already remarked, most punctuation, particularly
                        at the ends of verse lines, is abandoned after about line 20. Perhaps at this final
                        stage of touch‐up, <span class="persName">Margaret</span> (or perhaps <span class="persName">Margaret</span> as well as <span class="persName">John James</span>) intervened with a review. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> may even have been surprised by the demand for revision. The manuscript is unique
                        among the juvenilia as a fair copy that was subjected to a critique, resulting in
                        revisions made on the fair copy itself.</p>
                     <p>It may be no coincidence that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs marginal line‐numbering was arrested at line 60, since at lines 57–60 the most
                        extensive single passage is flagged for revision, with a long diagonal line and ×s
                        marking a quatrain about the constellation <span class="name">Libra (the Scales)</span>, ending in a mention of the <span class="name">Milky Way</span>. The passage may have been flagged merely because the original lines, both in draft
                        and fair copy, are somewhat incoherent: the lines develop a paradox of the <span class="name">Scales</span> being capable of weighing “nothing” yet containing a “thousand more”—more even than
                        “the beautiful <span class="name">milky way</span>”—but but with the implied object, <span style="font-style:italic">stars</span>, being absent from the lines. The omission may or may not have been deliberate, but
                        instead of revising to clarify the paradoxical conceit, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> substituted a couplet that veers to a different topic altogether—<span class="name">the Scales</span> as a symbol of justice, a traditional treatment of this constellation, particularly
                        in Roman astronomy (see the contextual gloss hanging from line 57, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#LIBRAGLOSS">“The scales that nothing to weigh would bear”</a>).</p>
                     <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> began the revision of the <span class="name">Libra</span> quatrain in pencil at the bottom of the inner fold of the pamphlet, sprawling across
                        the fold to the opposite recto, then blank (pp. 3–4), and coninuing onto the back
                        of the pamphlet (p. 4). Nine lines of cursive pencil text wrestle with the topic of
                        justice (see the textual gloss hanging from lines 57–60, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_textual.php#LIBRATEXTGLOSS">“that nothing to weigh would bear / . . . / More than than the beautiful milky way”</a>); and then, at the bottom and top‐right of the inner fold (pp. 3–4), he overwrote
                        this pencil draft with pen and ink, still in cursive, recasting the lines on <span class="name">Libra</span> as the couplet they became in the <span class="titlem">MS III</span> fair copy. Next, on remaining space in the middle of the inner recto (p. 3), and
                        over top of pencil draft on the back (p. 4), <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> drafted in pen and ink new lines on the <span class="name">Milky Way</span> as they appear in the <span class="titlem">MS III</span> fair copy (lines 65–69). In these new lines, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> expanded on the <span class="name">Milky Way</span>, previously mentioned only as a comparison with what stars could be weighed in <span class="name">Libra</span>ʼs scales, and now elaborated as the myth of the <span class="name">Milky Way</span> as a roadway to heaven. Revision on this larger scale toward the end of the poem
                        engages with topics of justice and of pagan “knowledge” versus <span class="orgName">Christian</span> “virtue”—a seriousness of purpose that lends perspective to the seemingly misplaced
                        squeamishness and correctness prompting the flags for revision earlier in the poem
                        (see <a class="link_ref" href="#MYTHS" title="Knowledge versus Christian Faith The Problem of Mythology">Discussion—Knowledge versus Christian Faith: The Problem of Mythology</a>).</p>

Vol 2”</span></a>, <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> is now presented as the first poem in an anthology, “POETRY”, the <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_poetry_anthology_2_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III Second Poetry Anthology</span></a>, where it precedes two <a class="link_ref" href="new_years_poems_note.php">New Yearʼs poems</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="time_blank_verse_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Time: Blank Verse”</span></a>, the New Yearʼs ode for <span class="date">January 1827</span>, and <a class="link_ref" href="the_sun_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“The Sun”</span></a>, the New Yearʼs ode for <span class="date">January 1828</span>.</p>
                  <p>Between the end of <span class="titlem">“The Sun”</span> and the next poem in the anthology, <a class="link_ref" href="glenfarg_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Glenfarg”</span></a>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> prominently printed the date <span class="date">“January 1 1828”</span>, floating between two parallel decorative rules. This label does not necessarily
                     signify that this poetry anthology (along with the preceding <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . .

That purpose presumably was served by a separate presentation copy of <span class="titlem">“The Sun”</span> and <span class="titlem">“Glenfarg”</span>, preserved in <a class="link_ref" href="msxi_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS XI</span></a>, in which the two poems are fair‐copied in the same order presented here, in <span class="titlem">MS III</span>. It is unknown how much time lapsed between the <span class="date">January 1828</span> New Yearʼs presentation of <span class="titlem">“The Sun”</span> and <span class="titlem">“Glenfarg”</span> and their placement following <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> as contributions to a new anthology. It seems likely that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> would not have waited long to fair‐copy <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> following his revision of the <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> fair copy, and that he finalized the poem in this <span class="titlem">MS III</span> version—assuming that no other fair copy intervened—as part of the anthology sometime
                     prior to the familyʼs departure in <span class="date">May</span> for the <a class="link_ref" href="tour_of_1828_note.php">Tour of 1828</a>.</p>

The second volume of <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy”</span> continues the familyʼs travels across <span class="placeName">Britain</span> that started with the tour to <span class="placeName">Hastings</span> described in <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . .

               <p><span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, like other poems and prose by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> of 1826-28 that mention the fixed stars and other astronomical phenomena, was composed
                  in context of popular education in astronomy for adults and children in the <span class="date">early nineteenth century</span> in Britain, which is surveyed in <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note.php">Astronomical Education</a>. Some of Ruskinʼs print sources connected with this broader educational trend can
                  be identified definitively by means of references in <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2”</span></a>, which also contains the second fair copy of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>. Other sources remain conjectural, especially a “lesson book” on astronomy mentioned
                  in <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III”</span></a>.</p>
               <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs purpose in <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> is more poetic than scientific, with his most original contribution to the catalogue
                  of stars consisting in the descriptive epithets he assigns to each of the constellation
                  names. In a note added to the poem belatedly in the compositional process, Ruskin
                  admits that his arrangement of constellation names is unsystematic with respect to
                  the starsʼ actual positions in the sky, although it is possible that the apparently
                  random ordering represents an imaginative act of spatial reasoning (see <a class="link_ref" href="#PROJECT" title="The Constellations as a Poetic Project">“The Constellations” as a Poetic Project</a>). The poem, in any case, is not entirely lacking in the influence of childrenʼs scientific
                  lessons in astronomy typical the period; and regardless of the aesthetic emphasis
                  in <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, his known sources tell us that he had access to basic information such as the cause
                  of the apparent positions of the constellations in the night sky relative to the revolutions
                  of the earth, and the practical applications of this knowledge, such as navigating
                  oneʼs way on a moonless night by finding the <span class="name">North Star</span>.</p>
               <p>It is difficult to measure the extent of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs acquaintance with the historical and mythological associations with the constellations,
                  since his epithets rarely allude to the stories. In this edition, contextual glosses
                  attached to each of the constellations named in the poem summarize the mythological
                  stories and historical information that was available to him in popular works of the
                  period, but in most cases the glosses can identify only what <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> may have known, not what he necessarily did know or was allowed or encouraged to
                  learn.</p>

               <h2><span class="headingNumber">1.8. </span><span class="head">“The Constellations” as Marking a Stage of Astronomical Education</span></h2>
               <p>See <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note.php">Astronomical Education</a> for the range of print texts that was available to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> as sources of basic instruction in astronomy. Chronologically, the composition of
                  <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> was positioned following a period in <span class="date">1826–27</span> when he had begun to read <span class="persName">John Aikin</span> and <a class="link_ref" href="barbauld_anna_laetitia_note.php"><span class="persName">Letitia Barbauld</span></a>ʼs <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span></a>, which contains dialogues covering some basic topics in astronomy, such as the forces
                  that drive the rotations of the solar system (see <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note.php#PRINTSOURCES-DIALOGUES">Astronomical Education: Scientific and Practical Astronomical Dialogues</a>; and <a class="link_ref" href="boyhood_books_note.php#EVENINGS">Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth: Physical Descriptions—<span style="font-style:italic">Beinecke</span> no. 4</a>).</p>
               <p>Following this introductory reading, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs period of composition, revision, and fair‐copying of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> in <span class="date">1827–28</span> would have accompanied or shortly followed his reading of additional educational
                  dialogues on astronomy, which pick up where the conversations in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span> leave off—namely, the astronomy of the constellations both as a discipline of practical
                  and scientific reasoning and as an appreciation of beauty. This stage of reading consisted
                  at least of volume 2, “Of Astronomy”, of <a class="link_ref" href="joyce_jeremiah_note.php"><span class="persName">Jeremiah Joyce</span></a>ʼs <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span></a>; and of passages in <a class="link_ref" href="day_thomas_note.php"><span class="persName">Thomas Day</span></a>ʼs <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The History of Sandford and Merton</span></span></a>, in which the Tutor, <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span>, draws on <span class="persName">Harry Sandford</span>ʼs practical experience in reading the night sky to spark <span class="persName">Tommy Merton</span>ʼs admiration for the beauty and wonder of the fixed stars (see <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note#PRINTSOURCES-DIALOGUES">Astronomical Education: Scientific and Practical Astronomical Dialogues</a>). <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> himself identifies his use of these latter sources for astronomical education in
                  <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2”</span></a>, whereas his reading of the rudimentary dialogues <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span></a> is presumptive, based on evidence of his familiarity with this work in <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I”</span></a>.</p>
               <p>It is possible that this first stage of astronomical education, preceding and contemporaneous
                  with the composition of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, also relied on one of the primers in astronomical science written for children in
                  the first third of the century (see <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note.php#PRINTSOURCES-PRIMERS">Astronomical Education: Astronomical Primers for Children</a>; This kind of text was more likely to emphasize a Christian approach, compared to
                  educational dialogues by Aikin and Barbauld, Joyce, and Edgeworth, which Ruskin favored.</p>
               <p>By <span class="date">1828–29</span>, one year beyond the composition, revision, and fair‐copying of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> recorded statistical astronomical information in his <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . .

                  primers for young readers. The identity of this type of source or sources used by
                  <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> remains elusive (see <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note.php#PRINTSOURCES-ATLASES">Astromical Education: Star Atlases</a>).</p>

               <p>At its most basic level, <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> is a catalogue of constellation names. As such, the poem shares some characteristics
                  with a primer, <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">An Introduction to Astronomy Intended for Little Children</span></span> (<span class="date">1817</span>)</a> by <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> (<span class="date">1775–1851</span>). While no record of this book or a work like it is recorded in the Ruskin family
                  library, <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> introduces the topic of the constellations with a heading identical to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs main title, <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, and follows that heading with subdivisions, each with its own heading, that sorts
                  the constellations into “Constellations in the Zodiac or Ecliptic”, “Constellations
                  to the North of the Ecliptic”, and “Constellations to the South of the Ecliptic”—subdivisions
                  that resemble <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs subtitle to his poem, “Northern, Some of the Zodiac, and Some of the Southern”.</p>
               <p>In each of these subdivisions, <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> merely lists the names of constellations—the Latin name followed by its English translation—which
                  matches <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs procedure in his catalogue poem, except for his added embellishment of a poetic
                  epithet to describe each constellation. <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> provides no information about each of the constellations; rather, she annotates the
                  respective lists with a Bible verse that mentions the stars and praises the <span class="persName">Creator</span> (<span class="titlem">KJV</span>, <span class="titlem">Dan.</span> 12:3; <span class="titlem">1 Chron.</span> 16:25–26; <span class="titlem">Ps.</span> 147:1, 4; <span class="titlem">Job</span> 9:1–4, 7–10; <span class="titlem">Job</span> 22:12; <span class="titlem">Job</span> 38:32) (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Sherwood</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Introduction to Astronomy</span></span></a>, 12–18).</p>

               <h2><span class="headingNumber">1.10. </span><span class="head">“The Constellations” as a Poetic Project</span></h2>
               <p>In <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The History of Sandford and Merton</span></span>, <span class="persName">Tommy Merton</span> proposes to <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span> to memorize the positions of the stars forming the constellations by “‘mak[ing] a
                  mark upon . . . paper for every star in <span class="name">Charlesʼ Wain</span>”, for example, “and I would place the marks just as I see the stars placed in the
                  sky; and I would entreat you to write the names for me, and this I would do till I
                  was acquainted with all the stars in the heavens’”. <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span> applauds the project but points out that paper is flat, whereas the sky, as <span class="persName">Tommy</span> says, “‘seems to rise from the earth on every side like the dome of a great church’”.
                  “‘Then if you were to have some round body’”, <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span> suggests, “‘I should think it would correspond to the different parts of the sky,
                  and you might place your stars with more exactness’”. The tutor accordingly supplies
                  <span class="persName">Tommy</span> with a paper‐covered ball, enabling him to devise his own celestial globe based on
                  his own observations of the constellations, remarking both the constellationsʼ relative
                  positions and their nightly movements in the sky. Starting by drawing his “favourite
                  constellation of <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span>”, <span class="persName">Tommy</span> next marks the constellation situated on the opposite side of the Pole‐star, which
                  <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span> identifies as <span class="name">Cassiopeia</span>; and then he is captured by the “grandeur and beauty” of the “glorious constellation”
                  <span class="name">Orion</span>, which “he could not help observing . . . by intervals, all the evening” as “it seemed
                  to pass on, in a right line drawn from east to west” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><span class="persName">Day</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The History of Sandford and Merton</span></span></a>, 164–65, 187–88). It seems that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem. <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, is his version of putting the constellations on paper.</p>
               <p>Just as in <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2”</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Harry</span> presents <span class="persName">Lucy</span> with an “introduction to astronomy” in the form of a flat diagram of <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span> copied from <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span>, so <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> might be viewed as his attempt to form a rounded globe in verse. First, <span class="name">Venus</span> is spotted “Glittering in the evening air” with “The belt of <span class="name">Orion</span> beside it”; then, higher up on the ecliptic, “mars appeareth high”; overhead, “the
                  greater bear is seen” with “charlesʼs wain” and other circumpolar constellations.
                  the poem along with and in the context of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs reading about astronomy, the poemʼs somewhat random and poeticized listing the
                  star clusters carries out in its own way the method, recommended by <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span>, of “remembering these stars [forming <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span>]” so that “you may very easily observe those which are next to them, and learn their
                  names too, till you are acquainted with the whole face of the heavens” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><span class="persName">Day</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">History of Sandford and Merton</span></span></a>, 163). Just so, in <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span>, the <span class="persName">Tutor</span> instructs his pupils, <span class="persName">Charles</span> and <span class="persName">James</span>, in the names and positions of the constellations.</p>
               <p>In the opening of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, the tutelage of <span class="persName">Day</span>ʼs, <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs, and <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs practical and scientific astronomy lessons is perceptible in the tactic of starting
                  from a prominent point of reference in the sky, although not, in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs case, with a constellation, but with a planet, <span class="name">Venus</span>, the so‐called Morning Star and Evening Star, which is a wandering rather than a
                  fixed star. “Dost thou see”, the poem asks, how <span class="name">Venus</span> is associated with the constellation <span class="name">Orion</span> as these bodies fall below the horizon in the west? From there, the poem turns to
                  the next planet on the ecliptic, <span class="name">Mars</span>, and then re‐orients to the circumpolar constellations overhead. The method does
                  not adopt <span class="persName">Tommy Sandford</span>ʼs more practical and reliable recommendation of first finding <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span> and then tracing its pointer stars to the <span class="name">Pole Star</span>; instead, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs sequence starts from “stars” traditionally regarded as the most beautiful—the <span class="name">Evening Star</span> and <span class="name">Orionʼs Belt</span>, “a glorious sight for all sky loving men”—and thence carries on to the circumpolar
                  formations. From this more sublimely oriented beginning, the poem does proceed to
                  follow <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span>ʼs advice, that “by remembering these stars [of <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span>], you may very easily observe those which are next to them, and learn their names
                  too, till you are acquainted with the whole face of the heavens” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><span class="persName">Day</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">History of Sandford and Merton</span></span></a>, 163). As <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem clicks along, however, while repeating “next” and “next” the sequence becomes
                  erratic. As suggested by the poemʼs title, which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> appears to have extended belatedly in order to account for “some of the <span class="name">zodiac</span> and some of the southern” constellations that had found their way into the poem along
                  with the survey of the visible “northern” sky (see <a class="link_ref" href="#TITLE" title="Title">Title</a>), the sequence reveals a logic at best only intermittently (see <a class="link_ref" href="#REAL-LIFE" title="Observations Actual and Poetic">Real‐life Observations</a>). Aware of the systematic procedure advised by his booksʼ astronomy lessons, he added
                  the caveat, “These constellations though they are next in this poetry are not next
                  in the sky”, to the second and final fair copy (<span class="titlem">MS III</span>). Whatever led his fancy, the poem is livelier than <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs bare and wooden lists set up alongside Bible verses for rote memorization.</p>

               <p><span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs lists of constellation names omit their respective numbers of stars, and her memorization
                  exercises hold scripture quotations at least as important as astronomical science.
                  The text does eventually explain rudimentary concepts, however, such as the <span style="font-style:italic">ecliptic</span> and celestial <span style="font-style:italic">equator</span>, which are necessary to understanding the principles governing how the lists of constellations
                  are subdivided into northern, southern, and zodiac groups. Whatever lesson book was
                  <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs source, his approach appears more poetic than religious, and ultimately less illuminating
                  scientifically, although perhaps reflecting a pedagogical assumption, which is shared
                  by <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>, that a childʼs act of naming and identifying heavenly bodies precedes understanding
                  of the physical laws that govern their motion and developing the spatial imagination
                  required to grasp the relation of the earthʼs revolutions to the apparent movement
                  of the constellations across the sky.</p>
               <p>In <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem, the largely random order in which the constellations are named suggests that
                  he had so far neglected understanding of these basic astronomical concepts, and <span class="persName">Lucy</span>ʼs drills a year later in <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III”</span> indicate limited advance since the lessons only double the memorization task. While
                  the poem begins logically by naming “northern” constellations, fixing on the familiar
                  circumpolar group, thereafter the sequence darts around the celestial globe, naming
                  “some” in the north, “some” in the south, and “some” in the <span class="name">zodiac</span>. Associative connections, if any, are thematic rather than scientific, such as his
                  abrupt plunges into the southern hemisphere, motivated apparently by a patriotic desire
                  to name a constellation that bears a British association (see Patriotic Astronomical
                  Education). Occasionally the sequence of naming is clustered within a circumscribed
                  region of the sky, but on the whole <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> subordinates scientific logic to aesthetic pleasure. As he declares in a caveat added
                  as a note to the second fair copy (<span class="titlem">MS III</span>): “These constellations though they are next in this poetry are not next in the sky”.</p>
               <p>The belated addition of that note to the second fair copy does suggest, however, that
                  <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> was at least gaining awareness of what he lacked in basic understanding of astronomical
                  science. <span class="persName">Lucy</span>ʼs memorization drills in <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III”</span> are dull compared to dreaming up poetic epithets in <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, but the constellation lists in <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy”</span> follow a more organized pattern compared to the poemʼs random naming, proceeding
                  generally from the north to the south on the celestial globe. This gain in organization,
                  while revealing little about what <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> may have learned conceptually over the intervening year about astronomical science,
                  perhaps registers a tempering of aesthetic glee with systematic learning. The approach
                  remains invested in the memorization exercises for lacks the specifically religious
                  aims and praise of the <span class="persName">Creator</span> emphasized in <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs scheme, the poem does share with her primer an emotional stir, and even that enthusiasm
                  seems to drop out of the later lessons for <span class="persName">Lucy</span>. Perhaps <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs astronomical education remained conflicted over the problem that arose when revising
                  the poemʼs conclusion in the <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> fair copy. In the revisions to the first fair copy, the praise of “virtue”—the closest
                  that <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> comes to <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs praise of the <span class="persName">Creator</span> in scripture quotations—is bound up with a problem of how to reconcile “history”
                  with Christian “knowledge”; and “history” appears to have included familiarity with
                  pagan myth, which <span class="persName">Margaret</span> flagged with ×s to be replaced or revised. One year later, in <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III”</span>, “knowledge” appears to have gained neither conventional piety nor poetic expression
                  in <span class="persName">Lucy</span>ʼs star lists (see <a class="link_ref" href="#MYTHS" title="Knowledge versus Christian Faith The Problem of Mythology">Knowledge versus Christian Faith: The Problem of Mythology</a>).</p>

               <h2><span class="headingNumber">1.12. </span><span class="head">Scientific and Practical Astronomical Dialogues</span></h2>
               <p>Probably the earliest sources of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs reading about the constellations, and the most cherished, are directly revealed
                  in his <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2”</span>, where <span class="persName">Harry</span> offers to “give . . . [<span class="persName">Lucy</span>] a drawing of <span class="name">charlesʼs wain</span> as an introduction to astronomy”. The drawing, which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> illustrates with his own drawing in the text, reproduces a diagram in volume 2, “Of
                  Astronomy”, of <span class="persName">Jeremiah Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span>. In <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs dialogue, the <span class="persName">Tutor</span> shows this diagram to his pupils, <span class="persName">Charles</span> and <span class="persName">James</span>, just as <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Harry</span> presents the drawing to <span class="persName">Lucy</span>, as a first step in learning “‘how to distinguish the stars, and . . . call them
                  by their proper names’”. The <span class="persName">Tutor</span> points out <span class="name">Charlesʼ Wain</span> in the night sky, and describes the formation using the diagram—four stars forming
                  a wagon, and three stars making the horses, all of them also forming part of a larger
                  constellation, the <span class="name">Great Bear or Ursa Major</span>. This constellation, he explains, can serve as a compass for finding oneʼs bearings
                  at night, without the sunʼs position to define east and west. As a northern, circumpolar
                  constellation, <span class="name">Charlesʼ Wain</span> is always visible on a clear night; and as the diagram shows, it points to the <span class="name">North Star (i.e., Polaris)</span> if one traces a line upward through the two stars forming the rear end of the wagon.
                  From this first point of reference, the <span class="persName">Tutor</span> proceeds to instruct <span class="persName">Charles</span> and <span class="persName">James</span> in the names and locations of other stars, constellations, and planets (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><span class="persName">Joyce</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span></a>, vol. 2, “Of Astronomy”, Coversation 2, <span class="titlem">“Of the Fixed Stars”</span>, 12–18, 250 opp. [pl. 1, fig. 1]).</p>
               <p>In <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs reading about the constellations, this episode in <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs dialogues formed a node of interlocking texts, for in <span class="persName">Maria Edgeworth</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank: A Sequel</span></span>, the <span class="persName">Engineer</span> marks passages in the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span> where <span class="persName">Frank</span> can find information about astronomy. <span class="persName">Frank</span>, in turn, recalls an episode in <span class="persName">Thomas Day</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">History of Sandford and Merton</span></span>, in which “<span class="persName">Harry Sandford</span> found his way out of a dark moor because he understood the guidance of the <span class="name">pole star</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank: A Sequel</span></span></a>, 2:141, 140). In <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Sandford and Merton</span></span>, the tutor, <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span>, cites <span class="persName">Harry Sandford</span>ʼs story of self‐preservation as an instance of practical uses to be derived from
                  scientific understanding, an emphasis likewise imparted but with more detailed and
                  sophisticated scientific information by the <span class="persName">Tutor</span> in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span>.</p>
               <p>In <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Sandford and Merton</span></span>, <span class="persName">Tommy</span> ensures they can find <span class="name">Charlesʼ Wain</span> again by diagramming the stars on paper, and he carries on to conceive of a celestial
                  globe in order to map all the constellations. <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span> obliges with a paper‐covered ball on which the boys can record their own observations
                  of the constellations. While the emphasis is on practical and scientific knowledge,
                  <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span> also encourages appreciation of natural beauty:</p>

               <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> is his answer to to putting the constellations on paper. In context of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs own <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2”</span>, the poem along with <span class="persName">Harry</span>ʼs drawing effectively forms <span class="persName">Lucy</span>ʼs “introduction to astronomy”; and in the context of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs reading about astronomy, the poemʼs somewhat random and poeticized listing the
                  star clusters carries out in its own way the method, recommended by <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span>, of “remembering these stars [forming <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span>]” so that “you may very easily observe those which are next to them, and learn their
                  names too, till you are acquainted with the whole face of the heavens” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><span class="persName">Day</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">History of Sandford and Merton</span></span></a>, 163). Just so, in <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span>, the <span class="persName">Tutor</span> instructs his pupils, <span class="persName">Charles</span> and <span class="persName">James</span>, in the names and positions of the constellations.</p>
               <p>In the opening of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, the tutelage of <span class="persName">Day</span>ʼs, <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs, and <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs practical and scientific astronomy lessons is perceptible in the tactic of starting
                  from a prominent point of reference in the sky, although not, in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs case, with a constellation, but with a planet, <span class="name">Venus</span>, the so‐called Morning Star and Evening Star, which is a wandering rather than a
                  fixed star. “Dost thou see”, the poem asks, how <span class="name">Venus</span> is associated with the constellation <span class="name">Orion</span> as these bodies fall below the horizon in the west? From there, the poem turns to
                  the next planet on the ecliptic, <span class="name">Mars</span>, and then re‐orients to the circumpolar constellations overhead. The method does
                  not adopt <span class="persName">Tommy Sandford</span>ʼs more practical and reliable recommendation of first finding <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span> and then tracing its pointer stars to the <span class="name">Pole Star</span>; instead, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs sequence starts from “stars” traditionally regarded as the most beautiful—the <span class="name">Evening Star</span> and <span class="name">Orionʼs Belt</span>, “a glorious sight for all sky loving men”—and thence carries on to the circumpolar
                  formations. From this more sublimely oriented beginning, the poem does proceed to
                  follow <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span>ʼs advice, that “by remembering these stars [of <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span>], you may very easily observe those which are next to them, and learn their names
                  too, till you are acquainted with the whole face of the heavens” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><span class="persName">Day</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">History of Sandford and Merton</span></span></a>, 163). As <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem clicks along, however, while repeating “next” and “next” the sequence becomes
                  erratic. As suggested by the poemʼs title, which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> appears to have extended belatedly in order to account for “some of the <span class="name">zodiac</span> and some of the southern” constellations that had found their way into the poem along
                  with the survey of the visible “northern” sky (see <a class="link_ref" href="#TITLE" title="Title">Title</a>), the sequence reveals a logic at best only intermittently (see <a class="link_ref" href="#REAL-LIFE" title="Observations Actual and Poetic">Real‐life Observations</a>). Aware of the systematic procedure advised by his booksʼ astronomy lessons, he added
                  the caveat, “These constellations though they are next in this poetry are not next
                  in the sky”, to the second and final fair copy (<span class="titlem">MS III</span>). Whatever led his fancy, the poem is livelier than <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs bare and wooden lists set up alongside Bible verses for rote memorization.</p>

               <h2><span class="headingNumber">1.13. </span><span class="head">Star Atlases</span></h2>
               <p><span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> advises: “A teacher, when hearing the class, should use globes, or plates, such as
                  may be found in most elementary books of astronomy, to assist the children in understanding
                  what they learn” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Introduction to Astronomy</span></span></a>, vii). Plates and globes depicted the mythical figures for which the constellations
                  were named; and plates were found in star atlases, which among other information related
                  the stories associated with the stars and constellations, such as the myth of the
                  <span class="name">Milky Way (Via Lactea)</span> that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> uses to frame his conclusion to the second fair copy (<span class="titlem">MS III</span>): “the ancients thought” it “the road / Which all their best and bravest trod / Unto
                  great <span class="persName">Jupiters</span> blest abode”.</p>
               <p> In <span class="date">1828</span>, if they had acquired <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span>, its exercises would surely have demanded too much of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs abilities. As remarked previously, the random order in which he names constellations
                  in his poem suggests that he failed to master even the most basic astronomical concepts,
                  as presented in <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs elementary primer. Nonetheless, the atlas would have appealed not only in its visual
                  depictions and prose summaries of myths; it would also have bolstered <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs pride in British achievements in astronomical discovery and science. A consistent
                  theme in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem is his observance of constellations with British associations, such as <span class="name">Cor Caroli (Charlesʼs Heart)</span>, <span class="name">Robur Caroli (Charlesʼs Oak)</span>, and <span class="name">Telescopium Herschelii (Herschellʼs Telescope)</span>.</p>
               <p>Still, a confirmed source of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs exposure to the mythology of the constellations remains elusive, as does a measure
                  of his knowledge of those stories. The contextual glosses identify the constellations
                  named in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem and summarize their stories, drawing on two sources published in the <span class="date">1820s</span>: <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span> and an American work (partly dependent on <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs), <span class="titlem">Astronomical Recreations</span> (<span class="date">1824</span>) by <span class="persName">Jacob Green</span> (<span class="date">1790‐1841</span>). How familiar this information would have been to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> himself in this period is unknown.</p>

            <p>It is possible that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> produced this poem by relying entirely on print sources, albeit not a single source.
               While <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs, <span class="persName">Day</span>ʼs, and <span class="persName">Maria Edgeworth</span>ʼs books are proven influences, their books refer to only a handful of the constellations
               named in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem. The addition of a tabular source like <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs, combined with <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs imagination, could account for the whole, but <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> hints at a still larger context of early Victorian astronomical instruction in the
               form of lectures, toys, and just real‐life observation. Did <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> engage in actual stargazing as preparation for any part of the poem? Does the poem
               reflect conditions of British astronomoical practice and popular education in the
               <span class="date">1820s</span>? Evidence is limited, but the introduction to astronomy provided by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs books itself pointed to the theatrical and real‐life entertainments that were readily
               available to youth.</p>

               <h2><span class="headingNumber">2.1. </span><span class="head">Observations Actual and Poetic</span></h2>
               <p>As indicated by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs sources, <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> is a bookish poem. Even in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs books, however, tutors begin study of astronomy by directing their pupilsʼ attention
                  to the evening sky. To what extent, if any, might <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs composition of his poem have involved actual observation? <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> opens his poem by hailing <span class="name">Venus</span> and <span class="name">Mars</span>. Planets are not an obvious starting point for charting the constellations: tutors
                  in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs books typically begin by asking pupils to find <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span>. As suggested by an earlier poem, <a class="link_ref" href="glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Glen of Glenfarg” (“Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill”)</span></a>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> had long been able to orient himself that far to the night sky. Equally striking
                  objects for young stargazers are <span class="name">Venus</span>, the Morning Star or Evening Star, and <span class="name">Mars</span>, the red planet. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs observation of the alignment of those planets could also lend support to dating
                  of the poem.</p>
               <p>In the poem, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> positions <span class="name">Venus</span> specifically as the Evening Star near the constellation <span class="name">Orion</span>. According to a digital‐age star chart, the <span class="titlem">Sky &amp; Telescope Interactive Sky Chart</span>, <span class="name">Venus</span> would have been visible from <span class="placeName">London</span> as the Evening Star, setting in the west along with <span class="name">Orion</span>m during <span class="date">April–June 1828</span>. During those same months, <span class="name">Mars</span> would have risen from the east, traveling “high . . . [in] the sky” a few hours after
                  <span class="name">Venus</span> had set.</p>
               <p>This particular configuration of <span class="name">Venus</span>, <span class="name">Mars</span>, and <span class="name">Orion</span> did not appear at any other time in <span class="date">1828</span>, and did not occur at all in <span class="date">1827</span>. Astronomically, then, the poemʼs introduction aligns with the evidence in <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB" title="Composition and Publication">Composition and Publication</a> supporting the year <span class="date">1828</span> as a probable period of composition or at least revision. April–May was the period
                  when <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> tyically prepared poems for his fatherʼs birthday in May, thus suggesting an occasion
                  as well as a terminus a quo for the start of either composition or revision of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SKYANDTELESCOPE"><span class="titlem">Sky &amp; Telescope, Interactive Star Chart and Celestial Almanac</span></a>, accessed <span class="date">12 April 2023</span>). This convergence of evidence enables us to imagine also that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> looked up from his books to the sky for a phenomenon with which to open his poem.</p>
               <p>Even so, that search for <span class="name">Orion</span> was likely inspired by <span class="persName">Tommy Merton</span>, who, “looking up to the sky . . . observed so remarkable a constellation, that he
                  . . . begged to know the name”. On learning it was called <span class="name">Orion</span>, he “was so delighted with the grandeur and beauty of this glorious constellation,
                  that he could not help observing it, by intervals, all the evening; and he was surprised
                  to see that it seemed to pass on, in a right line drawn from east to west; and that
                  all the stars he had become acquainted with moved every night in the same direction”.
                  In the opening four lines of the poem, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> echoes the alliterative modifiers with which <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span> describes the experience of gazing at the constellations: “‘I should think there
                  would be a very great pleasure in observing such a number of <span style="font-style:italic">glorious</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">glittering</span> bodies as are now above us’” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><span class="persName">Day</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The History of Sandford and Merton</span></span></a>, 187–88, 165 [emphasis added]).</p>
               <p>The bodies above that were visible at all times of the year to British youth were
                  the circumpolar constellations—the “northern” constellations, as <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> specified among the classifications tagged onto his main title. Of the constellations
                  named in lines 7–11 of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem, only <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span> is mentioned by the tutors in <span class="persName">Day</span>ʼs and <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs dialogues. An observer in <span class="date">April 1828</span> could, however, easily have followed <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs cues by looking up from <span class="name">Orion</span> setting in the west to trace the poemʼs network of constellations overhead. Locating
                  <span class="name">Ursa Major (the Great Bear)</span> in the center of the sky, the observer would find the “pointer” stars embedded in
                  <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span> (which forms part of <span class="name">Ursa Major</span>), using these to trace a path to the tip of <span class="name">Draco (the Dragon)</span>ʼs tail. Following the wind of the tail toward the northeast, the observer would turn
                  to the east to encounter <span class="name">Corona Borealis (the Northern Crown)</span>. Continuing to circle counter—clockwise back toward <span class="name">Ursa Major</span>, the observer would have found the next named constellation in the poem, <span class="name">Coma Berenices (Bereniceʼs Hair)</span>.</p>
               <p>Hereafter in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem, following the mapping of the circumpolar constellations, the sequence of
                  constellations becomes more erratic, with <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs repeated “next comes” ceasing necessarily to refer to formations that are adjacent
                  in the dome of the sky. In the second fair copy, in <span class="titlem">MS III</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> forestalled objections by adding the a note with the caveat: “These constellations
                  though they are next in this poetry are not next in the sky”. It is impossible to
                  know whether he added the note because he only then discovered the confusion or because
                  he was prodded to justify a more poetic than naturalistic procedure that he had adopted
                  from the start.</p>

               <p>After , <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> arrives at the <span class="name">Zodiac</span>, as also mentioned in his title, which may hint at another context for his interest
                  in astronomy. As a distinct activity from professional astronomy with its mathematical
                  orientation combined with observation—the less popularly accessible approach, which
                  <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Tutor</span> encourages over the mythological tradition—there thrived in the <span class="date">1820s</span> a popular form of astronomy education, which combined technology with art, modern
                  science with traditional elements such as the <span class="name">Zodiac</span>. The popular astronomy lecture was a theatrical entertainment, commonly known as
                  Lenten astronomy lectures since they could be held in <span class="placeName">London</span> theaters during the holy season, when plays were forbidden. The timing of these spectacles
                  fits with the proposed <span class="date">April–June 1828</span> period for composition of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, which might have been initiated by attendance at a lecture. (In <span class="date">1828</span>, Easter Day fell on <span class="date">6 April</span>. <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span>ʼs accounts for <span class="date">April 1828</span> include “Abernethys Lect<sup>rs</sup>” for 12<span style="font-style:italic">s</span>, but this entry probably refers to published lectures by the surgeon, <span class="persName">John Abernethy</span> [<span class="date">1764–1831</span>]; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><span class="titlem">Account Book</span></a>, 6r).</p>
               <p>The astronomy lecture circuit—originating in the <span class="date">late eighteenth century</span>, becoming a craze in the <span class="date">1820s</span>, and remaining a staple of popular science instruction at least until <span class="date">mid—century</span>—has been researched by <span class="persName">Hsiang—Fu Huang</span>, who finds that its performative and entrepreneurial aspects overlapped with the
                  insitutional framework of lecturing that was supposedly displacing these popular forms
                  of instruction in the <span class="date">1820s</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#HUANGSHAREDARENA"><span class="persName">Huang</span>, <span class="titlem">“A Shared Arena”</span></a>). A target audience for the lectures included children, as <span class="persName">Huang</span> notes (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#HUANGURANIA"><span class="titlem">“When Urania Meets Terpsichore”</span></a>, 60–61), astronomy being regarded as an uplifting area of knowledge religiously as
                  well as scientifically. As a guidebook of <span class="placeName">London</span> amusements solemnly assured parents about the content of Lenten astronomy lectures—even
                  as performed by <span class="persName">George Bartley</span> (<span class="date">1784–1858</span>), who was not a scientist but a comic actor, famed for his portrayals of <span class="persName">Shakespeare</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Falstaff</span>—the spectacle would convey “to the minds of their children the lofty and magnificent

               <p>Even as educational entertainments for children, however, the Lenten astronomy lectures
                  were regarded with some criticism by educators, as <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> would have known from <span class="persName">Maria Edgeworth</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank</span></span>. After <span class="persName">Frank</span> has attempted and failed on his own to construct an <span style="font-style:italic">orrery</span>, a model of the solar system, his parents take him and his cousin <span class="persName">Mary</span> to an astronomy lecture at a theater. The performance features something like the
                  large—scale, illuminated or “transparent” stage orreries with Greek—inspired names
                  like <span style="font-style:italic">Eidouranion</span>, which combined the older mechanical, three—dimensional orrery that reproduced the
                  revolutions of the sun and planets with transparancies projected by a magic lantern
                  (see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#HUANGURANIA"><span class="persName">Huang</span>, <span class="titlem">“When Urania Meets Terpsichore”</span></a>, 49–51, 66 n. 23). For <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>, criticism of these spectacles pertains not just to quack lecturers and creaky, dysfunctional
                  orreries, which <span class="persName">Huang</span> finds in satires of the day (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#HUANGURANIA"><span class="titlem">“When Urania Meets Terpsichore”</span></a>, 62–63); more fundamentally, <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span> points to conflicts with reformersʼ principles of effective pedagogy.</p>
               <p>The theatrical spectacle is a grand but passive presentation, discouraging learning
                  through experience and self—discovery. Even though <span class="persName">Frank</span> had failed to complete his own orrery because he over—reached his abilities, the
                  stage orrery is “particularly interesting to <span class="persName">Frank</span>” thanks only to “the pains he had taken, and the various attempts he had made, to
                  understand and to represent” the revolving bodies. The other “little children” in
                  the audience went “dead asleep” and “even he”, <span class="persName">Frank</span>, “after all his reading in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span>, had much difficulty sometimes in understanding both the machine and the lecturer”.
                  <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs most severe criticism is aimed at the failure to scale knowledge to the age—appropriate
                  accessibility of young listeners. The lecturer overwhelms the audience “with a vast
                  number of words, which” <span class="persName">Frank</span> “strained his attention” to understand, trusting that the lengthy explanations “were
                  all necessary”, yet “of which nearly half were nothing to the purpose” and put <span class="persName">Mary</span> to sleep altogether. As for the <span class="placeName">London</span> guidebookʼs promise of the theatrical augmentation of Beauty, Order, and Sublimity,
                  it is the sight of the real moon on the ride home that prompts a spontaneous reaction
                  from <span class="persName">Mary</span>: “‘How beautiful!’ said she: ‘and how—’ sublime! she would have said, but she did
                  not know the word well enough: she knew the feeling.” <span style="font-style:italic">Feelings</span> are represented as accessible, regardless of age and learning; and despite <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs promotion of the Industrial Sublime in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</span></span>, here <span class="persName">Frank</span> responds to <span class="persName">Mary</span>ʼs admiration: “How wonderful! What is the orrery compared to this, <span class="persName">Mary</span>! . . . How grand! how different from any thing that the most ingenious man in this
                  world can make!” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank: A Sequel</span></span></a>, 2:251, 253, 255, 249, 256, 257).</p>
               <p>The opposite effect on children was promised by promoters of astronomy as a theatrical
                  spectacle: astronomical science in particular, it was argued, benefits by the intervention
                  of art. According to the <span class="date">1826</span> guidebook, astronomy lectures are the epitome science enhanced of metropolitan “improvements
                  and amusements”:</p>

                           be deemed almost essential to success; and we would undertake that Urania need not

                  which, although extremely ingenious, are nevertheless almost unequal to the imitation

                  works of the <span class="persName">Creator</span>”. Yet, despite the interest the reader is assumed to take in two close pages of technical
                  description of how hydraulic improvements have brought the orrery closer to the operations
                  of the <span class="persName">Creator</span>, the accompanying engraving sets the machine in a “design of our own”—a moonlit natural
                  landscape like the scene that impresses <span class="persName">Mary</span> and <span class="persName">Frank</span> as tending to the disadvantage of technology (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#WELLBELOVEDLONDONLIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">London Lions for Country Cousins and Friends about Town</span></span></a>, 6–7).</p>

                     case with the four preceding scenes, but embedded in a peroration on the infinitude
                     of the universe: “. . . how in adequate must the utmost stretch of finite faculties
                     be to represent infinity! The stars, disposed in constellations, and surrounded by
                     concentric circles, may perhaps assist the imagination a little: The attempt in the
                     <span class="titlem">LAST SCENE</span>, if not admired, we hope will be forgiven. But was it possible we could actually
                     take our flight into infinite space, or be borne on the wings of lightning, to the
                     most distant fixed Star we can now see, even there, perhaps we should find ourselves
                     on the confines of creation, and see as many stars before us as we left behind! For
                     space has neither top nor bottom in it; it is a circle whose centre is every where,
                     but whose circumference is no where!” (pp. 36–37).</li>
               </ul>
               <p>According to this description, the <span class="titlem">“Last Scene”</span>, at least as delivered by the Walker family, which by <span class="date">1828</span> had passed into the management of <span class="persName">Deane Franklin Walker</span> (<span class="date">1778–1865</span> [<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#HUANGURANIA"><span class="persName">Huang</span>, <span class="titlem">“When Urania Meets Terpsichore”</span></a>, 50]), the most comprehensive view of the constellations was presented as the finale.
                  Could <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> have conceived of his poem as an ekphrastic version of this final, totalizing scene?
                  Apparently, in this show, a transparency exhibited a circle of the starry night, surrounded
                  by concentric rings to suggest infinitude. In an engraving by <span class="persName">I. Stow</span> (ca. <span class="date">1770–1823</span>), after <span class="persName">E. F. Burney</span> (<span class="date">1760–1848</span>), <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The proscenium of the English Opera House in the <span class="placeName">Strand</span>, (Late Lyceum.) as it appeared on the Evening of the <span class="date">21st March 1817</span>, with Walkerʼs Exhibition of the Eidouranion</span></span>, published by <span class="persName">Robert Wilkinson</span>, Scene 1 represented the earth and sun by turning the orbit vertically to the audience,
                  enclosing this revolution of the Eidouranion within a projection of an outer ring,
                  which showed the <span class="name">Zodiac</span> constellations. The <span class="name">Zodiac</span> constellations were represented by their respective mythological figures. Perhaps
                  the transparency for the Last Scene exhibited a similar ring of constellations in
                  their mythological guise, which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> in his way has reproduced.</p>
               <p>The beginning of the poem, however, starts with a version of Scene 1 in the Walkersʼ
                  exhibition—or more precisely, a portion of their Scene 4—with the rising and setting
                  of <span class="name">Venus</span> and <span class="name">Mars</span>. As noted earlier, the poem is atypical of <span class="persName">Day</span>ʼs and <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs introductions to the constellations, which begin with finding the circumpolar constellations
                  in the sky. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> incorporates that observation as the second stage of his poem. The <span class="name">Zodiac</span> constellations form a distinct piece within the poem. The most significant point
                  to draw from the context of the Lenten astronomy lectures is that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs catalogue may have attempted a sublime totality, an expression of religious awe.</p>

               <p>If avoiding either a specifically religious or a specifically profane constellation
                  list, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> does go out of his way to name star groups with patriotic British associations. As
                  an effect of dividing the new from the old constellations, <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> highlights the <span class="date">seventeenth‐century</span> Carolingian inventions: <span class="name">Cor Caroli (Charlesʼs Heart)</span> and <span class="name">Rober Carolinum (Charlesʼs Oak)</span>. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> names not only these but also the more recent <span class="name">Telescopium Herschelii (<span class="persName">Herschell</span>ʼs telescope)</span>. Moreover, he lends an English inflection to names where possible: <span class="name">Apus</span> is not the tropical Bird of Paradise but the northern Swallow; <span class="name">Leo</span> is not the fierce Nemean Lion but the “generous” and therefore, one supposes, British
                  kingly beast (see contextual glosses)</p>

               <h2><span class="headingNumber">3.2. </span><span class="head">Knowledge versus Christian Faith: The Problem of Mythology</span></h2>
               <p>While <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> cannot avoid the mythical names of the constellations, she avoids the myths themselves,
                  defining the constellations neutrally as “remarkable groups or clusters of stars,
                  to which names of various figures have been given”. Who the figures may be is not
                  pursued, and the question implicitly crushed by the declaration: “We find in Scripture
                  the glory of the righteous in the resurrection compared to that of the stars; by which
                  comparison we find, that their splendour will partake of that of the Son of God himselfȁ
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Sherwood</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Introduction to Astronomy</span></span></a>, 12).</p>
               <p>Neither are the myths elaborated in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem. That he knew more than what <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> or a book like hers aimed for him to know, however, is evident from a line that he
                  deleted in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>: “Then the dread medusas head!” (replaced by the modern constellation, <span class="name">Herschelʼs Telescope</span>). Ignored by <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>, although she lists <span class="name">Perseus</span>, the very mention by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> of <span class="name">Medusa</span>ʼs “dread” decapitated head approaches that myth closely, compared to the vagueness
                  or irrelevance of most of his other epithets considered as condensing the stories
                  of the constellations. Thus, this clue suggests a source that made the pagan myths
                  available, although <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> avoided alluding to those stories and suppressed—or was told to suppress—allusions
                  that slipped into fair copy.</p>
               <p>Certainly the poem is interested more in naming than in mapping; the poem is a catalogue,
                  not a star chart. At the same time, neither is it a narrative—despite mythic storytelling
                  being the expected alternative to a scientific or practical approach. If <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poetic naming suggests a distant and, in some cases, contradictory relation to
                  the myths commonly associated with the constellations, that reticence could be explained
                  not only by religious objections to heathenism but also by scientific disapproal of
                  superstition. In <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs dialogues on astronomy, the <span class="persName">Tutor</span> and his scholars are dismissive of mythology, though easily prompted to quote descriptive
                  poetry:</p>

               <p>Instead of myths, the lesson that <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Tutor</span> dwells on is the arbitrariness underlying the naming systems of astronomy. The imagined
                  patterns in the sky whereby the ancients ordered and named the constellations, the
                  <span class="persName">Tutor</span> emphasizes, were arbitrary constructions:</p>

                        <p><span style="font-style:italic"><span class="persName">Tutor</span></span>. “The ancients, that they might the better distinguish and describe the stars, with
                           regard to their situation in the heavens, divided them into constellations, that is,
                           systems of stars, each system consisting of such stars as were near to each other,
                           giving them the names of such men or things, as they fancied the space which they
                           occupied in the heavens represented”.</p>

               <p>The arbitrariness of naming extends beyond the ancient constellations to modern systems:
                  “‘If you look on the [celestial] globe’”, the <span class="persName">Tutor</span> continues, “‘you will observe, that . . . [lesser stars] are distinguished by the
                  different letters of the Greek alphabet’”, which are also assigned arbitrarily (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span></a>, vol. 2, “Of Astronomy”, Conversation 3, <span class="titlem">“Of the Fixed Stars, and Ecliptic”</span>, 23). As a more sophisticated system, the <span class="persName">Tutor</span> leads his pupils from the diagram of <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span> to a celestial globe, which he uses to orient the constellations to the ecliptic
                  and equator; and then he directs the boys to an <span style="font-style:italic">ephemeris</span>, a catalogue of star positions (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span>, vol. 2, “Of Astronomy”, Conversations 2–4</a>, 12–47). Modern ephemerides were based on exacting observations and mathematical
                  computations, which were the pride of scientifically advanced nations that produced
                  these star catalogues. It has been argued, however, that their forbidding tables made
                  the ephemerides a “primary culprit” in driving away public interest in astronomy,
                  displacing the appeal to popular imagination that the stars had presented in the annual
                  almanacs with a professionalization of the science that seemed inaccessible to omateur
                  “sky‐loving men”, in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs phrase (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#KDONNELLYBOREDOM"><span class="persName">Donnelly</span>, <span class="titlem">“On the Boredom of Science”</span></a>, 493–97).</p>
               <p>As a less exacting task, <span class="persName">Day</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span> contrives a paper globe on which <span class="persName">Tommy</span> and <span class="persName">Harry</span> can draw the constellations (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The History of Sandford and Merton</span></span></a>, 165, 187). <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem can perhaps be viewed as an ersatz globe, listing constellation names in a
                  sequence that oscillates back and forth from west to east and back again, or that
                  possibly (in places) circles counter—clockwise—a pattern, if he intended any pattern
                  at all, that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> could have plotted only by referencing a celestial globe or illustrated star charts
                  in a book.</p>
               <p>One can test this theory by searching for a pattern in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs sequence of constellations. At line 12, following the circumpolar constellations,
                  the next listed constellation is <span class="name">Cygnus (the Swan)</span>. Assuming, for consistencyʼs sake, the hour of <span class="name">Orion</span>ʼs setting in the west in <span class="date">April 1828</span>, <span class="name">Cygnus</span> would have lain on the northeast horizon, beyond <span class="name">Draco</span>. Then the following item, <span class="name">Cor Caroli (Charlesʼs Heart)</span> would have directed the viewer back toward the center of the dome, within <span class="name">Canes Venatici (Hunting Dogs)</span>, between <span class="name">Ursa Major</span> and <span class="name">Coma Berenices</span>. For the next, the now obsolete constellation, <span class="name"><span class="persName">Herschell</span>ʼs Telescope</span>, one would have turned back toward the west, where it would have been rising as <span class="name">Orion</span> was setting, located within <span class="name">Auriga (the Charioteer)</span>. The next, <span class="name">Equuleus (Little Horse)</span>, is found between <span class="name">Pegasus</span> and <span class="name">Delphinus</span>, which would have lain back toward <span class="name">Cygnus</span>, rising on the northeast horizon as the evening advanced on April 28. The next named
                  constellation, the <span class="name">Goose (Anser)</span>, does keep within range of <span class="name">Equuleus</span>; however, to get from <span class="name">Goose</span> to <span class="name">Hare</span>—<span class="name">Anser</span> to <span class="name">Lepus (hare)</span>—again sends one in the opposite direction, to the feet of <span class="name">Orion</span>.</p>
               <p>At this point in the <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> draft, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> originally cited <span class="name">Lyra (the Lyre)</span>, which he replaced with <span class="name">Lepus (Hare)</span>. Since <span class="name">Lyra</span> is found in the same quadrant as <span class="name">Anser</span> and <span class="name">Cygnus</span>, by substituting <span class="name">Hare</span>, which lies at <span class="name">Orion</span>ʼs feet, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> maintained a pattern of back‐and‐forth, west‐to‐east and back again (or counter‐clockwise
                  circling), but in naming <span class="name">Hare</span> he also dropped below the celestial equator to “some of the southern” constellations,
                  as his title mentions. A few lines later, he will plunge into the corresponding southern
                  constellations on the opposite side with <span class="name">Crux (Southern Cross)</span>. It seems to break the pattern that, intervening between these southern constellations,
                  <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> lists <span class="name">Ursa Minor (Lesser Bear)</span>, which contains the <span class="name">Pole Star</span>, but perhaps he paused midway across the sky only to rhyme <span style="font-style:italic">hare</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">bear</span>. He may also have wanted <span class="name">Ursa Minor</span>. to stand as a barrier between <span class="name">Anser</span>, “stupid goose”, and “cunning fox” (<span class="name">Vulpecula</span>), which follows <span class="name">Ursa Minor</span> in the list. Traditionally, Fox and Goose were treated as a single constellation,
                  <span class="name">Vulpecula et Anser</span>, with the Goose caught in the Foxʼs mouth (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 182–83). By separating them, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> characteristically avoided violence.</p>
               <p>It seems a foolʼs errand to look for an equivalent of <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span>ʼs paper globe in what <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> himself characterized as a poetic order—“constellations . . . next in this poetry
                  . . . not next in the sky”. Whatever poetic idea directed his eye (and intriguingly,
                  governed his choices for revision) in moving from constellation to constellation,
                  the most dramatic poetic evolution of the poem lay in the addition and revision of
                  the poemʼs conclusion in the two fair copies. For this development, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> may have looked neither to a real nor a paper sky, but to a theatrical projection.</p>
