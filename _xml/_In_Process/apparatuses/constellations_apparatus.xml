                    <p>In the earlier of two surviving fair copies, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> centered 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">THE CONSTELLATIONS</hi>&#x0201D;</title> above the column of lines. 
                        Then, in what appears an afterthought, he added &#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">NORTHERN</hi>&#x0201D; to the right in the margin, on the baseline of the main title; 
                        and then below &#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">NORTHERN</hi>&#x0201D;, awkwardly in the margin to the right of the opening lines of the poem, 
                        he added &#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">SOME OF THE ZODIAC / AND SOME OF THE SOUTHERN</hi>&#x0201D;. 
                        The awkwardness suggests that he extended the title as he expanded the poem, perhaps revealing one reason why he gave up 
                        on this fair copy and revised some of the lines (see <ref type="internal" corresp="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>).</p>

                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> incorporated his revisions to the first fair copy, including 
                        allowing space to center the subtitle below the main title, breaking the three lines as 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">THE CONSTELLATIONS / NORTHERN, SOME OF THE ZODIAC AND / SOME OF THE SOUTHERN</hi>&#x0201D;</title>.</p>

                        is untitled, since the surviving pages begin with lines from the middle of the poem.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> seems to set up the association in the prose section of <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL2">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title>,

                    <p><persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> seem to intend an earlier <date when="1827">1827</date> date, associating the poem with the rough draft of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title> 
                        in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, which they misdate as <date when="1827">1827</date>

                        but the editors&#x02BC; grounds for associating this draft with the draft of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title> also contained therein can perhaps 
                        be neither confirmed nor denied, since a piece of that draft manuscript of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;Constellations&#x201D;</title> is now very likely missing

                        As noted in nos. 1 and 4, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> seems habitually to have included his previous year&#x02BC;s presentation poems

                        Thus, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> could have existed as a New Year&#x02BC;s gift for <date when="1827">1827</date>,

                        As remarked in the compositional history of "The Monastery", the episode of Scott's plot narrated in this passage 
                        describes how the English <persName type="fictional" corresp="#STAWARTHBOLTON">Captain Stawarth Bolton</persName><!--&#x02bc;s visit to the <placeName type="fictional" corresp="#TOWEROFGLENDEARG">Tower of Glendearg</placeName>, in which he-->

                        it is speculated that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s selection of this episode 
                        reflects a preoccupation with the recent adoption of his cousin,

                        Ruskin cements composition of "The Constellations" onto this family drama underlying composition "The Monastery" when, 
                        in "Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2", which precedes "The Constellations" in MS III, Harry offers to give Lucy 
                        "a drawing of charles’s wain as an introduction to astronomy". Lucy assenting that "she would like it very much", 
                        Ruskin situates the avatar of his cousin in his paper world of text.</p>

                        <p>The treatment of text in books 1-2 of "The Monastery", as fair-copied in MS III, has more in common 
                            with "The Constellations", as fair-copied in RF T70, than it does with what immediately precedes the Scott poem 
                            in MS III--the 1827 anthology, <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title></ref>--or 
                            even with books 3&#x2013;4 of "The Monastery", which are set apart from books 1-2 in MS III 
                            (COMPPUB1"The Monastery: Composition and Publication--Stage One of Composition). For the poems in 
                            <title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title>, Ruskin formed large, spindly characters with pen and ink, 
                            which he had learned to use recently, in April 1827. For both "The Monastery", books 1-2, and the "The Constellations", RF T70. 
                            He also largely avoided punctuation for the 1827 works, whereas he punctuates both of these fair copies of "The Constellations" and "The Monastery", 
                            he adopted a comparatively miniscule print-lettering, more like a serif book type. Perhaps also in imitation of typography, 
                            Ruskin added carefully formed punctuation marks to "The Monastery" and "The Constellations"--punctuation that is almost entirely absent 
                            from the 1827 poems. Moreover, the marks in the two later poems share a distinctive obsessiveness and eccentricity. 
                            Almost every line of books 1-2 of "The Monastery" is punctuated, regardless of need grammatically and rhetorically, 
                            and only at the ends of lines. This obsessive observance abruptly ceases at book 2, line 80, at the top of page 79. 
                            Just so, every line of the RF T70 "Constellations" is capped with a punctuation mark until line 20, 
                            where the practice stops. In most instances, the use of the punctuation marks seems arbitrary: while the full-stop periods usually make grammatical sense, 
                            the commas, colons, and (in "The Monastery) an upside-down semicolon seem interchangeable. Finally, in both fair copies, 
                            the lines are also exactingly numbered by fives on the left side of the poems. It appears as if Ruskin layered over his text 
                            with bookish characters to give the appearance of print, without entirely understanding their function--until he tired of the process.</p>
                        
                        <p>How much time divides the closely related bookish treatments of the longer poems from the 1827 lyric-descriptive poems? 
                            Fortunately, the two longer poems can be triangulated with a third, the fair copy of <ref type="apparatus" target="eudosia_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201c;Eudosia&#x201d;</title></ref>, 
                            which is dated by Ruskin as <date when="1828-09-28">28 September 1828</date>. Here too are found the miniscule lettering, 
                            punctuation ending each line until it doesn't, line numbering on the left. Thus, these ambitious (and inevitably incomplete) projects--a versified novel, 
                            a catalogue of the constellations, "a poem on the universe"--belong to the final third of the year, 
                            following the Ruskins' aborted spring Tour of 1828, cut short by the death of Jessie Richardson, 
                            and followed by a period of mourning, and the resettlement of her children, including the adoption 
                            of Mary Richardson into the Herne Hill household.</p>
                        
                        <p>More speculatively, one might order the three works chronologically according to skill. 
                            "Eudosia" is perhaps the earliest, since it frequently exhibits a bizarre mark made of two dots, like a colon on its side or a two-point ellipsis. 
                            This mark does not appear in "The Monastery", where all the colons are right-side up, although the semicolons are upside-down, 
                            with the comma atop the point. "The Constellations" exhibits no incorrectly formed marks, though only twenty lines carry any punctuation at all. 
                            Still, this correctness, combined with the prominence
                            
                            
                            
                            of poetry densely at the start of the poem, but abandoned punctuation later. 
                            Since the , suggesting that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> gradually lost interest in that feature of the fair copy; 
                            and in both, the punctuation is eccentric, his use of colons seeming more decorative than functional, although his rhetorical use of commas and periods 
                            seems marginally more coherent in the opening lines of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title> <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;Constellations&#x201D;</title> as compared with the opening lines

Presumably, though not certainly, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> made these revisions shortly before fair&#x2014;copying the revised text in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, 
                            perhaps in <date notBefore="1827-09" notAfter="1828-04">late 1827&#x2014;early 1828</date>. 
                            <!--(thus, incidentally, representing one of the earliest datable examples of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s longhand script).--> 
                            In fact, the original fair copy in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title>, and not just its revisions, may have only shortly predated the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version&#x2014;or 
                            at least the second page of the fair copy may have been significantly closer in time to the revisions. 
                            Starting at line 53 of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title>, the fair&#x2010;copy hand suddenly appears larger, and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> abandons the line numbering in the margin&#x2014;suggestions perhaps that, 
                            at this point, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may already have decided to sacrifice this fair copy to revision (see also textual note for line 54).<!--

                        the original manuscript in the photograph is otherwise unknown, as are the occasion and date of its original purpose. 
                        The most valuable information revealed about the original is that it presented a fair&#x2010;copy text that predated 
                        the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version. The <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title> text runs the full length of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version, 
                        but several lines, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> crossed out and replaced by revisions scrawled in the margins, are incorporated in their revised form into the text of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version.</p>
                    
                    <p>Moreover, the photograph <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title> preserves a rare instance a manuscript that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> evidently intended as a presentation copy 
                        but that he spoiled for that purpose with revisions&#x2014;though whether he made the revisions before the original fair copy served its purpose, 
                        or after he had made some formal use of the manuscript, cannot be determined. The original manuscript consisted of a single folded sheet, 
                        with text fair&#x2014;copied on two sides of a single leaf (i.e., pp. 1&#x2013;2), leaving the other leaf (i.e., pp. 3&#x2013;4) blank originally. 
                        The fair&#x2014;copy text is print&#x2014;lettered in a small hand, using pen and ink, thus dating the manuscript as no earlier than <date when="1827-04">April 1827</date>, when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first adopted that medium
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="hand_note.php">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</ref>). Then, at some point after making this fair copy, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> revised lines of the poem, using a cursive hand that is 
                        larger, sprawling, and freer than the original fair&#x2014;copy lettering. He made his initial revisions in pencil and then in several cases overwrote the penciled cursive revisions 
                        using pen and ink, likewise in a cursive hand.</p>
                    
                    <p>On the recto of the first leaf of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title> (p. 1 of the original fair&#x2014;copy text), <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote his revisions in the margin of the fair copy; 
                        and on the verso of that leaf (p. 2), he entered his corrections in the margin of the fair copy but extending across the fold 
                        into the facing page (originally blank). Here, too, he revised using pencil and then in some cases overwrote the revisions in ink. 
                        On the verso of the latter leaf (p. 4), he drafted revised lines in cursive using a pen. Pencil cursive text does appear beneath these pen&#x2014;and&#x2014;ink revised lines, 
                        but this pencil cursive handwriting belongs to a different text, unrelated to the constellations poem.</p>
                    
                    On the last page of the folded sheet (i.e., p. 4) in the photograph, revised lines of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> 
                        appear to be written over top of a lighter script of lines that I am unable to connect definitely with any extant fair&#x2010;copy juvenilia: 
                        &#x201C;[to(?)] heaven but / not [to(?)] hell [for when (?)] / they went to / place [I(?)] say [that then (?)] / they took quite / a different way / and . . .&#x201D; 
                        (the writing continues for four more, illegible lines). The scrawled draft suggests notes for a sermon, although it might represent attempted revision of 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> since some lines were given a more pious cast in the final version 
                        (see, e.g., the textual notes for the lines &#x201C;The scales in which twas vainly said / The crime and virtues of men were weighed,&#x201D; and for the closing meditation on the superiority of virtue to knowledge). 
                        No surviving fair&#x2010;copy lines, however, even remotely match the faint draft.-->

                    continues its draft beyond this declaration, Ruskin clearly changed his mind in
                    mid&#45;draft about concluding the poem, and therefore he omitted this line

                    >b</hi>). There appear to be at least three stages of composition reflected in
                    the manuscript.</p>
                <p>First, the photograph shows a neatly printed, ink fair copy, which runs the full
                    length of the poem, adhering to the text of <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS
                        IA</ref> at least from line 27, the first line currently extant. This fair
                    copy, moreover, improves the draft in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS
                        IA</ref> by capitalizing first letters of each line (and capitalizing the
                    entire first word of line 1); by punctiliously punctuating the end of each line,
                    through line 19 (after which end&#45;line punctuation is dropped); and by
                    inserting marginal line numbering at the left of the text.</p>
                <p>Next, the fair copy was used for revision, which appears to be represented in two
                    stages, first apparently in pencil and second in ink. Because the photograph can
                    show only relative darkness and texture of these insertions, the two stages
                    cannot always be definitively distinguished. It is unquestionable, however, that
                    the photograph shows a palimpsest since, in places, a dark ink hand overwrites a
                    much lighter hand, and under magnification the lighter hand shows the variable
                    texture of pencil stroke, and the darker hand the evenness of ink.</p>
                <p>Apparently in the first stage of this revision, someone using the lighter hand
                    marked the ends of lines with a short diagonal line (/), sometimes with a double
                    diagonal (//), but marked other lines with a cross (X), and the latter show
                    cancellations and insertions&#x02014;in the form of strikethrough and caret,
                    within the line; in the form of longhand insertion, in the margin. (Minor
                    variations occur in this pattern.) Presumably, the lines with Xs were flagged
                    for revision, but by whom, and whether by the same person who simultaneously or
                    subsequently wrote the insertion, one can only guess. On the whole, the marginal
                    insertions appear to be in pencil, the same color and texture as the diagonals
                    and Xs. The second stage of revision, insofar as it can be distinguished from
                    the first, appears to be represented by the ink overwriting. But the two stages
                    may be only apparent, and the actual sequence more complex.</p>
                <p>The longhand in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref> is somewhat
                    awkward, in keeping with the fact documented in family letters that Ruskin had
                    only recently started practicing longhand as well as the use of ink (see <ref
                        type="note" target="ruskinshand.html">Ruskin&#x02019;s Hand</ref>). It
                    is possible, however, that more than one hand is represented in the
                    revisions.</p>
                <p>There appear to be several possible reasons why the fair copy shown in <ref
                        type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref> was sacrificed to revision. Ruskin
                    may have felt that the fair&#45;copy was spoiled by the error in line 54,
                    which he ended with <hi rend="italic">appear,</hi> thus repeating the rhyme word
                    at the end of the previous line, in place of <hi rend="italic">bear,</hi> which
                    ends line 54 in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA</ref>, and to which he
                    returned in <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS III</ref>. Moreover, about the
                    same place, starting with with line 53 in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF
                        T70</ref>, the printing becomes noticeably larger, as if he was suddenly in
                    a hurry. Perhaps most importantly, two significant confusions arise in the sense
                    of the text at about this point.</p>
                <p>First, the pair of couplets starting at line 57 about the Scales and the Milky
                    Way, which made little sense in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA</ref>,
                    made even less sense in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref>; and
                    hence, lines 57&#x02013;60 of <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref>
                    are heavily scored through (and after line 60, Ruskin also stopped marginally
                    numbering the lines). First, it appears, Ruskin revised the first of these
                    couplets, concerning the scales, to arriving at the <ref type="mss"
                        target="3.html">MS III</ref> version (&#x0201C;The scales in which twas
                    vainly said / The crimes and virtues of men were weighed&#x0201D; [lines
                    57&#x02013;58]). Draft for these lines appear in ink draft at the bottom of
                    this sheet, overwriting an earlier, canceled pencil version (that earlier
                    version apparently still related the Scales to the Milky Way, but the lines are
                    largely illegible in the photograph).</p>
                <p>Then, in place of lines 59&#x02013;60 of <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF
                        T70</ref>, concerning the Milky Way, Ruskin composed five new lines and
                    inserted them as lines 65&#x02013;69 of <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS
                        III</ref>. The draft, which is worked out on both sides of the sheet
                    (including what would have been the blank p. 4 of the <ref type="mss"
                        target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref> folded fair copy), exhibits some tension
                    between an Evangelical assessment of pagan myths and the classical lines that
                    won out in <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS III</ref>. On p. 4, the
                    underwriting in pencil reads, &#x0201C;[to(?)] heaven but / not [to(?)] hell
                    [for when (?)] / they went to / place [I(?)] say [that then (?)] / they took
                    quite / a different way / and this is all that Ive to say about the beauty [(?)]
                    milky way.&#x0201D; Overwriting this are lines approximating, but not
                    identical to the <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS III</ref> version:
                    &#x0201C;which all their best and bravest trod / of heroes that their
                    countrys good / espoused and neer in angry mood / unto great jupiters blest
                    abode.&#x02019; The final version, in <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS
                        III</ref>, takes a middle way between the Christian piety of the pencil
                    draft and the classical patriotism of the ink draft: &#x0201C;But oh that
                    wonder of them all / Which milky way europeans call / And which the ancients
                    thought the road / Which all their best and bravest trod / Unto great Jupiters
                    blest abode.&#x0201D; (The first three lines of this version are worked out
                    in ink draft on p. 3 [inside spread, recto] of <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html"
                        >RF T70</ref>, &#x0201C;but oh that wonder of them all / which milky way
                    europeans call / and which the ancients thought the road.&#x0201D;)</p>
                <p>Another confusion toward the end of the <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF
                        T70</ref> fair copy (line 64, or line 62 in <ref type="mss" target="3.html"
                        >MS III</ref>), which may have contributed to Ruskin&#x02019;s giving up
                    this fair copy to revision, arose evidently from a muddle over the order of the
                    constellations, which failed to conform with the linear order of his <ref
                        type="note" target="catalog.html">catalog poem</ref>. Line 64 in the earlier
                    version, &#x0201C;I wish I had not observed the lyre,&#x0201D; harkened
                    back to line 17, &#x0201C;After that doth come the lyre.&#x0201D; At
                    both these points in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref>, a revision
                    about the &#x0201C;frightened hare&#x0201D; is entered in the margin,
                    which ultimately replaced line 17.</p>
                <p>The hand for these changes indicate a growing hurry and restlessness. As
                    suggested in Date, the evidence may point to hurried preparations for New

                            the poem, along with <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName>&#x02BC;s drawing, effectively forms <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;introduction to astronomy&#x201D;; and in the context of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s reading about astronomy, 
                        the poem&#x02BC;s seemingly mechanical exercise of listing the star clusters carries out the method, recommended by <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName>, of &#x201C;remembering these stars

                        <p>In his poem, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> adopts the tactic of <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s tutors by starting from a prominent point of reference&#x2014;not, in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s case, a constellation, but 
                            a planet, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name>, the so&#x2010;called Morning Star and Evening Star, a wandering rather than a fixed star. In this instance, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> is associated with the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> 
                            as these bodies fall below the horizon in the west, and then the poem re&#x2010;orients to the circumpolar constellations overhead 
                            After this, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> carries on to list the formations supposedly in a sequence, the lines of the poem clicking along by repeating &#x201c;next&#x201D;; 
                            however, the organization, although not without logic, becomes more erratic (see <ref type="internal" target="#REAL-LIFE">Real&#x2010;life Observations</ref>).</p>

                            For most of the constellation names and mythological associations, he used a source that remains to be identified. In the editorial glosses to the poem, 
                            some connections are made with books known to have been owned by the family; for the present, the mythology associated with the constellations is glossed 
                            using an American text of the period, <title type="book" corresp="#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><hi rend="italic">Astronomical Recreations</hi></title>

                        <p>It is possible that Ruskin produced this poem by relying entirely on print sources. Despite the simplicity and even numbingly repetitive structure 
                            of its verse catalogue of names, however, the poem prompts significant questions about the context of scientific education in which it was produced. 
                            Did Ruskin engage in actual stargazing as preparation for any part of the poem. Does the poem reflect conditions of British astronomoical practice 
                            and education in the 1820s? Evidence is limited, but the introduction to astronomy provided by Ruskin's familiar scientific dialogues 
                            by Joyce, Day, and Edgeworth could have not have sustained this poem beyond its opening dozen or so lines.</p>

                            <p>As indicated by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s sources, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> is a bookish poem. 
                                Even in Ruskin's books, however, tutors begin study of astronomy by directing their pupils' attention to the evening sky. 
                                To what extent, if any, might Ruskin's composition of his poem have involved actual observation? 
                                Ruskin opens his poem by hailing <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> and Mars. 
                                Planets are not an obvious starting point for charting the constellations: tutors in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s books 
                                typically begin by asking pupils to find Charles's Wain. Nonetheless, Venus as the Morning Star or Evening Star and Mars as the red planet present striking objects to introduce young people to stargazing. 
                                Incidentally, the evidence might lend support to dating of the poem.</p>
                            
                            <p>In the poem. Ruskin positions Venus specifically as the Evening Star near the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>.
                                According to a digital&#x2010;age star chart, the Sky &#x0026; Telescope Interactive Sky Chart, 
                                <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> would have been visible from <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> as the Evening Star, 
                                setting in the west along with <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>m 
                                during <date notBefore="1828-04" notAfter="1828-06">April&#x2010;June 1828</date>. During those same months, 
                                <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARS">Mars</name> would have risen from the east, traveling "high . . . [in] the sky" 
                                a few hours after <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> had set.</p>
                                <!--(Another bright object at that time, appearing low in the evening sky, which an observer might have confused with a planet, was <name type="astronomical" corresp="#SIRIUS">Sirius or &#x201C;Dog Star&#x201d;</name>, 
                        in the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CANISMAJOR">Canis Major</name> directly below <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>.)-->

                                Astronomically, then, the introduction aligns with the evidence in <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref> 
                                supporting the year 1828 as the probable period of composition. April-May was the period when he tyically prepared poems for his father's birthday in May, 
                                thus suggesting at least an occasion as well as a terminus a quo for the start of composition on "The Constellations"

                                This convergence of evidence enables us to imagine also that Ruskin looked up from his books to the sky for a phenomenon with which to open his poem.</p>
                            
                            <p>Even so, that search for Orion was likely inspired by Tommy Merton, who, "looking up to the sky . . . observed so remarkable a constellation, that he . . . begged to know the name". 
                                On learning it was called Orion, he "was so delighted with the grandeur and beauty of this glorious constellation, 
                                that he could not help observing it, by intervals, all the evening; and he was surprised to see that it seemed to pass on, 
                                in a right line drawn from east to west; and that all the stars he had become acquainted with moved every night in the same direction". 
                                In the opening four lines of the poem, Ruskin echoes the alliterative modifiers with which Mr. Barlow describes the experience of gazing at the constellations: 
                                "'I should think there would be a very great pleasure in observing such a number of <hi rend="italic">glorious</hi>, <hi rend="italic">glittering</hi> bodies as are now above us'"

                                constellations, as Ruskin specified among the classifications tagged onto his main title. Of the constellations named in lines 7-11 of Ruskin's poem, 
                                only Charles's Wain is mentioned by the Tutors in Day's and Joyce's dialogues. An observer in April 1828, however, could easily have followed Ruskin's cues by 
                                looking up from <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> setting in the west 
                                to trace the poem's network of constellations overhead. Locating <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major (the Great Bear)</name> in the center of the sky, 
                                the observer would find the &#x201C;pointer&#x201d; stars embedded in <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name> (which forms part of Ursa Major), using these to trace a path 
                                to the tip of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#DRACO">Draco (the Dragon)</name>'s tail. Following the wind of the tail toward the northeast, the observer would turn to the east to encounter 
                                <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CORONABOREALIS">Corona Borealis (the Northern Crown)</name>. Continuing to circle counter-clockwise back toward Ursa Major, the observer would have found the next named constellation in the poem, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#COMABERENICES">Coma Berenices (Berenice&#x02BC;s Hair)</name>.</p>

                                Ruskin's poem perhaps works like an ersatz globe, listing constellation names in a sequence that oscillates back and forth from west to east and back again, or that possibly circles counter-clockwise--a pattern,

                                which would have lain back toward Cygnus, rising on the northeast horizon as the evening advanced on April 28. The next named constellation, the Goose (Anser), does keep within range of Equuleus; 
                                however, to get from Goose to Hare&#x2014;Anser to <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEPUS">Lepus</name> (hare)&#x2014;again sends one in the opposite direction, to the feet of Orion.</p>
                            
                            <p>At this point in the RF T70 draft, Ruskin originally cited Lyra (the Lyre), which he replaced with Lepus (Hare). 
                                Since Lyra is found in the same quadrant as Anser and Cygnus, by substituting Hare, which lies at Orion's feet, 
                                Ruskin maintained a pattern of back-and-forth, west-to-east and back again (or counter-clockwise circling), but in naming Hare he also 
                                dropped below the celestial equator to "some of the southern" constellations, as his title mentions. A few lines later, he will plunge into the corresponding southern constellations 
                                on the opposite side with Crux (Southern Cross). It seems to break the pattern that, intervening between these southern constellations, 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> lists <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMINOR">Ursa Minor</name> (Lesser Bear), 
                                which contains the Pole Star, but perhaps he paused midway across the sky only to rhyme <hi rend="italic">hare</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bear</hi>. 
                                He may also have wanted Ursa Minor to stand as a barrier between Anser, "stupid goose", and "cunning fox" (<name type="astronomical" corresp="#VULPECULAETANSER">Vulpecula</name>), 
                                which follows Ursa Minor in the list. Traditionally, Fox and Goose were treated as a single constellation, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VULPECULAETANSER">Vulpecula et Anser</name>, 
                                with the Goose caught in the Fox's mouth (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><persName corresp="#IRIDPATH">Ridpath</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><hi rend="italic">Star Tales</hi></title></ref>, 182-83). 
                                By separating them, Ruskin characteristically avoided violence.</p>

                            <p>After <!-- to come -->, Ruskin arrives at the Zodiac, as also mentioned in his title, which may hint at another context 
                                for his interest in astronomy. As a distinct activity from professional astronomy with its mathematical orientation combined with observation--the 
                                less popularly accessible approach, which Joyce's Tutor encourages over the mythological tradition--there thrived in the 1820s a popular form of astronomy education, 
                                which combined technology with art, modern science with traditional elements such as the Zodiac. The popular astronomy lecture was a theatrical entertainment, 
                                commonly known as Lenten astronomy lectures since they could be held in London theaters during the holy season, when plays were forbidden. 
                                The timing of these spectacles fits with the proposed April-June 1828 period for composition of "The Constellations", which might have been 
                                initiated by attendance at a lecture. (In 1828, Easter Day fell on 6 April. John James Ruskin's accounts for April 1828 include

                            <p>The astronomy lecture circuit--originating in the late eighteenth century, becoming a craze in the 1820s, 
                                and remaining a staple of popular science instruction at least until mid-century--has been researched by Hsiang-Fu Huang, 
                                who finds that its performative and entrepreneurial aspects overlapped with the insitutional framework of lecturing 
                                that was supposedly displacing these popular forms of instruction in the 1820s 
                                (Huang, "A Shared Arena"). A target audience for the lectures included children, as Huang notes 
                                ("When Urania Meets Terpsichore", 60-61), astronomy being regarded as an uplifting area of knowledge 
                                religiously as well as scientifically. As a guidebook of London amusements solemnly assured parents 
                                about the content of Lenten astronomy lectures--even as performed by George Bartley (1784-1858), 
                                who was not a scientist but a comic actor, famed for his portrayals of Shakespeare's Falstaff--the spectacle 
                                would convey "to the minds of their children the lofty and magnificent ideas that Astronomy supplies"--namely,</p>

                            <p>Even as educational entertainments for children, however, the Lenten astronomy lectures were regarded 
                                with some criticism by educators, as Ruskin would have known from Maria Edgeworth's <!-- title -->Frank. 
                                After Frank has attempted and failed on his own to construct an <hi rend="italic">orrery</hi>, a model of the solar system, 
                                his parents take him and his cousin Mary to an astronomy lecture at a theater. The performance 
                                features something like the large-scale, illuminated or "transparent" stage orreries with Greek-inspired names like <hi rend="italic">Eidouranion</hi>, 
                                which combined the older mechanical, three-dimensional orrery that reproduced the revolutions of the sun and planets 
                                with transparancies projected by a magic lantern (see Huang, "When Urania Meets Terpsichore", 49-51, 66 n. 23). 
                                For Edgeworth, criticism of these spectacles pertains not just to quack lecturers and creaky, dysfunctional orreries, 
                                which Huang finds in satires of the day ("When Urania Meets Terpsichore", 62-63); more fundamentally, 
                                Edgeworth points to conflicts with reformers' principles of effective pedagogy.</p>
                            
                            <p>The theatrical spectacle is a grand but passive presentation, discouraging learning through experience and self-discovery. 
                                Even though Frank had failed to complete his own orrery because he over-reached his abilities, the stage orrery is 
                                "particularly interesting to Frank" thanks only to "the pains he had taken, and the various attempts he had made, 
                                to understand and to represent" the revolving bodies. The other "little children" in the audience went "dead asleep" 
                                and "even he", Frank, "after all his reading in Scientific Dialogues, had much difficulty sometimes in understanding both the machine and the lecturer". 
                                Edgeworth's most severe criticism is aimed at the failure to scale knowledge to the age-appropriate accessibility of young listeners. 
                                The lecturer overwhelms the audience "with a vast number of words, which" Frank "strained his attention" to understand, 
                                trusting that the lengthy explanations "were all necessary", yet "of which nearly half were nothing to the purpose" and put Mary to sleep altogether. 
                                As for the London guidebook's promise of the theatrical augmentation of Beauty, Order, and Sublimity, 
                                it is the sight of the real moon on the ride home that prompts a spontaneous reaction from Mary: 
                                "'How beautiful!' said she: 'and how&#x2014;' sublime! she would have said, but she did not know the word well enough: 
                                she knew the feeling." <hi rend="italic">Feelings</hi> are represented as accessible, regardless of age and learning; 
                                and despite Edgeworth's promotion of the Industrial Sublime in <!-- title -->Harry and Lucy Concluded, 
                                here Frank responds to Mary's admiration: "How wonderful! What is the orrery compared to this, Mary! . . . How grand! 
                                how different from any thing that the most ingenious man in this world can make!" 
                                (Edgeworth, Frank: A Sequel, 2:251, 253, 255, 249, 256, 257).</p>
                            
                            <p>The opposite effect on children was promised by promoters of astronomy as a theatrical spectacle: 
                                astronomical science in particular, it was argued, benefits by the intervention of art. 
                                According to the 1826 guidebook, astronomy lectures are the epitome science enhanced of metropolitan "improvements and amusements":</p>

                                the most comprehensive view of the constellations was presented as the finale. Could Ruskin have conceived of his poem 
                                as an ekphrastic version of this final, totalizing scene? Apparently, in this show, a transparency

                                In an engraving by I. Stow (ca. 1770-1823), after E. F. Burney (1760-1848), <hi rend="italic">The proscenium of the English Opera House in the Strand, (Late Lyceum.) as it
                                appeared on the Evening of the 21st March 1817, with Walker’s Exhibition of the Eidouranion</hi>, published by Robert Wilkinson, 
                                Scene 1 represented the earth and sun by turning the orbit vertically to the audience, enclosing this revolution of the Eidouranion within a projection of an outer ring, which showed the Zodiac constellations. 
                                The Zodiac constellations were represented by their respective mythological figures. 
                                Perhaps the transparency for the Last Scene exhibited a similar ring of constellations in their mythological guise,
                                which Ruskin in his way has reproduced.</p>
                            
                            <p>The beginning of the poem, however, starts with a version of Scene 1 in the Walkers' exhibition--or more precisely, a portion of their Scene 4--with 
                                the rising and setting of Venus and Mars. As noted earlier, the poem is atypical of Day's and Joyce's 
                                introductions to the constellations, which begin with finding the circumpolar constellations in the sky. Ruskin 
                                incorporates that observation as the second stage of his poem. The Zodiac constellations form a distinct piece within the poem. 
                                The most significant point to draw from the context of the Lenten astronomy lectures is that Ruskin's catalogue 
                                may have attempted a sublime totality, an expression of religious awe.</p>
