                    <head type="section">Title</head>
                    <p>In the earlier of two surviving fair copies of the poem (see <ref type="internal" target="#MAJORMS">Manuscripts</ref>), 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="rft70_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title></ref>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> centered 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">THE CONSTELLATIONS</hi>&#x0201D;</title> above the column of lines. 
                        Then, in what appears an afterthought, he added &#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">NORTHERN</hi>&#x0201D; to the right in the margin, on the baseline of the main title; 
                        and on a second line below &#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">NORTHERN</hi>&#x0201D;, he placed, awkwardly, in the margin to the right of the opening lines of the poem, 
                        &#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">SOME OF THE ZODIAC / AND SOME OF THE SOUTHERN</hi>&#x0201D;. 
                        The added, trailing subtitle suggests that he extended the title as he expanded the poem, perhaps indicating one reason why he gave up 
                        on this fair&#x2010;copy manuscript, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>, and used the same sheet to revise some of its lines (see <ref type="internal" corresp="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>).</p>
                    
                    <p>In the second surviving fair copy, in <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> incorporated his revisions to the first fair copy, including 
                        allowing space to center the subtitle properly below the main title and above the first line, breaking the three lines as 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">THE CONSTELLATIONS / NORTHERN, SOME OF THE ZODIAC AND / SOME OF THE SOUTHERN</hi>&#x0201D;</title>.</p>
                    
                    <p>The fragment of draft of the poem, which is bound in <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title></ref>, 
                        lacks a title. Since the (unnumbered) lines in this manuscript start with line 27 as fair&#x2010;copied, 
                        presumably a sheet containing draft of preceding lines has been lost, which may have included a title. The first state of the title is unknown, therefore, 
                        and we can only speculate how the subtitle may have reflected the method of composition at that stage.

                        <head type="subsection"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title></head>
                        <p>A facsimile of a manuscript&#x2014;the whereabouts of the original being unknown&#x2014;this item consists of two photographs, which document a verticqlly folded sheet 
                            containing a fair copy of the poem in pen&#x2010;and&#x2010;ink print lettering in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand, along with revisions of the text in his cursive hand, both ink and pencil. 
                            Possibly, the photographs were taken in the course of preparing the 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title></ref>; if so, 
                            the facsimile was not cited or reproduced in the edition. The photographs are held by <orgName corresp="#RUSKINLIBRARYLANCASTER">The Ruskin</orgName> at <orgName corresp="#LANCASTERU">Lancaster University</orgName>, 
                            catalogued as <ref type="apparatus" target="rft70_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title></ref>.</p>
                        
                        <p>The folded sheet was photographed spread open and laid flat, with one photograph showing pages 4 and 1 (from left to right), 
                            and the other photograph showing the reverse side, pages 2 and 3 (from left to right). The manuscript reveals at least two major stages of composition, 
                            a first stage of fair copying, and a second stage of heavy revision. The fair copy occupies pages 1&#x2013;2 (i.e., both sides of the first leaf), 
                            while originally the remaining pages 3&#x2013;4 (the second leaf) would have been left blank. Subsequently, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> used this blank space, as well as the margins of pages 1&#x2013;2, for revisions. 
                            Thus, the facsimiles preserve a rare instance of a manuscript containing a fair copy of an early work by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> that he subsequently revised using the same sheet.</p>
                        
                        <!--<p> Then, at some point after making this fair copy, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> revised various lines of the poem, using a cursive hand that is 
                            larger, sprawling, and freer than the original fair&#x2010;copy lettering. It appears that he made his initial revisions in a pencil cursive hand and then, in some lines of revision, overwrote the penciled cursive words
                            using pen and ink, likewise in a cursive hand. At least one of the cursive pencil marginal changes (line 54) appears to be in the hand of <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>, 
                            but this instance corrects a mistranscription from the pencil draft; it does not impose a change on <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s original text, as do the marginal revisions in his own hand. 
                            Whether <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> made these revisions before the original fair copy served some purpose such as a presentation, 
                            or revised it after he had made some formal use of the manuscript, cannot be determined.</p>
                        
                    <p>On the recto of the first leaf shown in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title> (p. 1 of the original fair&#x2014;copy text), <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote his revisions in the margin of the fair copy; 
                        and on the verso of that leaf (p. 2), he entered his corrections in the margin of the fair copy but extending across the fold 
                        into the facing page (which would have been blank in the original state of the fair copy). Here, too, he appears to have revised using pencil and then in some cases overwrote the revisions in ink. 
                        On the verso of the latter leaf (p. 4), he drafted a few lines of a conclusion in pencil and then overwrote in pen and ink.</p>
                        
                        <p>However, on the last page of the folded sheet (i.e., p. 4), the revised lines of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> 
                            are written over top of a lighter script of lines that I am unable to connect definitively with any extant fair&#x2010;copy juvenilia: 
                            &#x201C;. The scrawled draft suggests notes for a sermon, although it might represent attempted revision of 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> since some lines were given a more pious cast in the final version 
                            (see, e.g., the textual notes for the lines &#x201C;The scales in which twas vainly said / The crime and virtues of men were weighed,&#x201D; and for the closing meditation on the superiority of virtue to knowledge). 
                            No surviving fair&#x2010;copy lines, however, even remotely match the faint draft.</p>-->

                        Judging by the little the editors wrote about the poem, they based their dating on an association of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title> 
                        with a poem they declare contemporaneous, <ref type="apparatus" target="monastery_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        although they leave the nature of this association unexplained 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 2:260 n. 1). 
                        Their method is sound but their conclusion inexact.</p>
                    
                    <p>The physical basis of this association is the similarity of the fragments of rough draft in a pencil, cursive hand&#x2014;so similar that the two drafts 
                        were apparently mistaken as belonging to the same work (see <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php#COLLATION"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>: Collation of the Original Manuscript</ref> and 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php#COLLATION"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>: Contents, <hi rend="italic">b</hi></ref>). 
                        For the place of this draft in the chronological sequence of drafting, revising, and fair&#x2010;copying <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title>, see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>. 
                        Here it suffices to explain that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand in these draft manuscripts, which is a sprawling cursive in pencil with occasional substitutions in pen&#x2010;and&#x2010;ink cursive, 
                        cannot be earlier than his first use of pen and ink in <date when="1827-04">April 1827</date>; and that the compositional history of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>, 
                        places its <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> draft fragment, which contains lines of book 2 of the poem, no earlier than <date when="1827-08">August 1827</date> and possibly starting as late as <date when="1828-11">November 1828</date>, 
                        following the family&#x02BC;s return to <placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName> from the <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tours_of_1826-27_note.php"><date when="1827">Tour of 1827</date></ref> to <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> 
                        (see <ref type="apparatus" target="monastery_apparatus.php#DATE"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>: Date</ref> and 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="monastery_apparatus.php#COMPPUB"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>: Composition and Publication</ref>).</p>
                    
                    <p>As another physical feature besides the similarity of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> rough drafts linking <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title> chronologically 
                        with the composition of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>, the first fair copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title> 
                        (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>) shares orthographic eccentricities of punctuation with the fair copy of books 1&#x2013;2 of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title> 
                        (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>). For the first twenty lines of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title>, each line ends with punctuation, occasionally a colon or full&#x2010;stop period, 
                        but most frequently a prominent comma formed to look like book print, with a dot and a curl. After twenty lines of this observant punctuation, the marks abruptly stop. 
                        This pattern is identical in the fair copy of book 1 and the first eighty lines of book 2 of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>, 
                        in which almost every line of verse ends with a punctuation mark until the punctuation gives out altogether. The pattern suggests that 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have added the punctuation to these poems all at once, layering the marks over top of the already fair&#x2010;copied text, only to grow tired of the exercise and quit. 
                        Thereafter, in both fair copies, only an occasional punctuation mark internal to a verse line appears&#x2014;a comma or an apostrophe, which is regularly spaced along with the surrounding characters, 
                        indicating that the mark was inserted in the course of fair&#x2010;copying. Moreover, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s penmanship for the punctuation is similar in the two fair copies, 
                        with the marks at the ends of lines of verse tending to float above the baseline.</p>
                    
                    <p>These practices contrast markedly with the very sparse punctuation in both the fragmentary rough drafts of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title> 
                        and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title> in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> and with the fair&#x2010;copy 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                        The poems in the latter collection exhibit, moreover, an awkward learner&#x02BC;s stage of penmanship, including tracing in ink over top of characters formed initially with pencil. 
                        These factors put distance between the <date when="1827">1827</date> <title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title> and the fair copies of 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title> and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>, 
                        which in the eccentricity of their punctuation resemble the usage in <ref type="apparatus" target="eudosia_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201c;Eudosia&#x201d;</title></ref> 
                        (<ref type="apparatus" target="msiv_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIV">MS IV</title></ref>), which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> dated <date when="1828-09-28">28 September 1828</date> on its title page. 
                        While the significance of that date within the compositional history of <title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201c;Eudosia&#x201d;</title> is obscure, 
                        the triangulation of that project&#x02BC;s punctuation practices with those of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title> and 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title> appear to situate the latter two projects decisively in <date when="1828">1828</date>.</p>
                    
                    <!--<p>There is no question that the earliest surviving manuscript is the <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title></ref> draft,

                        Its text, including minor revisions in ink, was the basis for the fair&#x2010;copy photographed as <ref type="apparatus" target="rft70_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title></ref> (or the basis, at least, of the portion of text it represents).

                    <p>Composition and fair&#x2010;copying during the first months of <date when="1828">1828</date> accord well with the placement of the second fair copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title>,

                        and the poem&#x02BC;s placement juxtaposed with the second volume of <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL2">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title> <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> emphasizes a thematic connection between the poem and the prose tale,

                        (This fair copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> also precedes a fair copy of <ref type="apparatus" target="the_sun_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHESUN">&#x201C;The Sun&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        which was composed for <date when="1828-01-01">New Year&#x02BC;s, 1 January 1828</date>.) That <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>s&#x02BC;s writing appears to have progressed little by the time he composed and fair&#x2010;copied <title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201C;Eudosia&#x201D;</title> several months later&#x2014;the same kind of catalog poem on a grandiose scale, 
                        fair&#x2010;copied with the same kind or orthographic eccentricities and even weirder punctuation&#x2014;can be attributed to a long period of family mourning for the death of his aunt. 
                        His father would have been preoccupied at home and in <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>, making arrangements for his sister&#x02BC;s estate and orphaned children.</p>
                    
                    <p>Remaining open to question is whether composition of the initial draft of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> could have begun as early as a date in 
                        <date when="1827">1827</date>, as <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> supposed. 
                        A factor that might argue for confining composition to the <date notBefore="1828-01-01" notAfter="1828-04-30">first quarter of 1828</date>  
                        is the possibility&#x2014;admittedly open to question&#x2014;that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> based his opening lines on planetariy observations that were visible in the sky over <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> only during those months, 
                        and not in <date when="1827">1827</date>. Those details, which survive in the opening lines of the poem as fair&#x2010;copied, are missing along with the first page(s) of draft from the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> manuscript. 
                        Thus, a genesis of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> draft commencing, say, in <date notBefore="1827-10" notAfter="1827-12">the fourth quarter of 1827</date> cannot be ruled out<!--; however, 
                        similarities between the first fair copy, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>, and the fair copy of books 1&#x2013;2 of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title> (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>) point to a more likely date of inception in <date when="1828">1828</date>

                    <p>From surviving documents, a clear chronology is established based on revisions of one document being incorporated in the next.

                        are incorporated into the copytext of the fair copy shown in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>; 
                        and strikethroughs and substitutions in the latter are in turn incorporated into copytext for the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> fair copy. 
                        This genetic history tracks a similar and roughly contemporaneous record of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s development of the poem, <ref type="apparatus" target="monastery_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title></ref>,

                        Only <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201D;</title>, however, includes a stage of composition in which a fair copy

                    <p>As a stage of development in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s compositional methods, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> along with 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title> represent a significant advance, which sprang from learning to use pen and ink in <date when="1827-04">April 1827</date> 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="hand_note.php">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</ref>). For the first time, we see preserved draft containing deletions, substitutions, and insertions, both in pencil and in ink, 
                        most of them in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand. At least one of the interventions is in the hand of <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>, 
                        but this is limited to correcting a mistranscription from the preceding draft. <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> proofread; she did not herself revise <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s text. She did censor, however, 
                        by marking text she deemed inappropriate in some way. Thus, these states of text open a window onto <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s compositional process as an interaction with his audience, 
                        his parents&#x2014;with his mother acting as proofreader and, to a limited extent, as editor. Perhaps these states of draft and fair copy were preserved for this reason, 
                        that they recorded a distinct stage of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s learning to write as an interactive process.</p>

                            and from that point the text extends for 49 lines on all four sides of a vertically folded sheet. 
                            The surviving text starts at the top of 1r of the manuscript, lacking title or context, evidently in mid&#x2010;career of the poem. 
                            While nothing definitive can be determined about whether this manuscript is missing a witness to the original beginning of its text, 
                            or nothing can be proved about what that opening text was, it is likely that the missing draft closely matched the text as fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>, 
                            given the consistency of the proofreading marks from start to finish on that later manuscript 
                            (see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY">First Fair Copy [<title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>])</ref>).</p>
                        
                        <p>It is possible that the now missing, opening piece of the manuscript was originally bound in 
                            <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, which in its current state has been damaged and unbound, with possible losses of contents.

                        <p>The hand is recognizably <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s cursive, identical to the cursive hand in his holograph <ref type="apparatus" target="jr_to_jjr_1827-05_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="#jr_to_jjr_1827-05"><date when="1827-05">May 1827</date> letter to his father</title></ref>. 
                            The latter document&#x2014;the earliest surviving example of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s use of pen and ink&#x2014;is composed almost entirely in cursive using a pencil, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> exchanging the pencil for pen and ink only for the closing of the letter, which he also wrote in cursive. 
                            He continued beyond the signature by appending two poems, still using a pen but switching to print lettering. Similarly here, at the end of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title>, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> switches from pencil to pen and ink for a closing, &#x201C;I end&#x201D;, written in cursive. 
                            Perhaps he reserved pen and ink for closings in these early cursive manuscripts because the ink suggested to him a sense of finality.</p>
                            
                            <p>In this draft version of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title>, 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> also uses pen and ink for a few minor revisions, making substitutions in ink by striking through pencil draft with a pen and writing the substituted word above. 
                            This usage, too, may have suggested finality to him, in act of polishing the verse. Alternatively or additionally&#x2014;and one suspects this to be the case in the <title type="letter" corresp="#jr_to_jjr_1827-05"><date when="1827">1827</date> letter</title>&#x2014;<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            felt more at ease manually in dipping a pen to form the strokes of print letters as compared with maintaining the flow of cursive. With respect to penmanship, then, 
                            the constrained use of pen and ink in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIACONSTELLATIONS"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;<name type="astronomical" corresp="#CEPHEUSCONSTELLATION">cepheus</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#BOOTES">bootes</name> now&#x201d;</title></title> 
                            represents an earlier developmental stage, comparable to the <title type="letter" corresp="#jr_to_jjr_1827-05"><date when="1827">1827</date> letter to his father</title>, 
                            whereas the first fair copy, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>, shows him using a pen to write longer phrases, but over top of the same phrases in pencil.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears to have ended the poem twice in draft. At the bottom of the inside recto page of the folded sheet (2r), 
                            he wrote &#x201C;end&#x201D; in pencil, cursive; and on the same line, to the left, he wrote &#x201C;I end&#x201D; in ink, also cursive&#x2014;the ink <hi rend="italic">end</hi> being presumably the second of the two, 
                            though the order cannot be distinguished from the material evidence. This <hi rend="italic">finis</hi> follows <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CAPRICORNUS">Capricornus (the Goat)</name>, 
                            the last&#x2010;listed of the constellations in all three manuscript versions (line 64 in the second fair copy, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>): 
                            &#x201c;and the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CAPRICORNUS">goat</name> that is formed in the arched sky&#x201c;. 
                            In draft as well as fair copy, this line carries lexical markers of closure&#x2014;for one, by beginning the line uniquely with <hi rend="italic">and</hi>, as if to say, 
                            <hi rend="italic">and finally</hi>; and for another, by ending the line with a flourish supplied by the quaintly poetic modifier <hi rend="italic">arched</hi> (in sources of this poetic diction, see the contextual gloss for <hi rend="italic">arched sky</hi> in the witnesses).</p>
                        
                        <p>Another ending is found on the back of the folded sheet (2v), where <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> added nine lines beyond the ending at the foot of the preceding page (2r). 
                            Below these nine addtional lines, on a separate line by itself, he again wrote &#x201C;I end&#x201D; in pencil longhand; 
                            and to the right of that <hi rend="italic">finis</hi>, he wrote &#x201C;I end&#x201D; in ink longhand. 
                            (Again, presumably the phrase written in ink was subsequent to the pencil phrase, but the evidence is indeterminate.) 
                            These nine lines form the peroration of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> as fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>.</p> 
                           
                            <p>As originally concluded, therefore, if the &#x201C;I end&#x201D; on 2r truly indicates an earlier intention,

                            represented a less ambitious work poetically, aiming solely at a catalogue of stars without any summary reflection on its meaning.

                                regardless of grammatical or rhetorical need, and the marks are used exclusively at the ends of lines. This obsessive but misinformed observance abruptly ceases at book 2, line 80, at the top of page 79 of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> fair copy. 
                            Just so, the end of every line of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title> <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;Constellations&#x201D;</title> fair copy is notched with a punctuation mark until line 20, 
                            where the practice abruptly stops. Where used, the punctuation often seems arbitrary. While the full&#x2014;stop periods make grammatical sense in most instances, 
                            the commas, colons, and (most prominently in <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>) an upside&#x2014;down semicolon seem interchangeable in their rhetorical placement. 
                            Both these fair copies give the impression that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> layered over the texts 
                            with bookish punctuation to convey the appearance of print, without understanding the grammatical and rhetorical function of the marks. 
                            (Another bookish touch in both manuscripts is the numbering of the lines by fives in the left margin.) 
                            Finally, in both fair copies, the punctuation markup stops abruptly at an arbitrary place, 
                            suggesting that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> grew tired of the exercise, ran out of time, or was informed about his erroneous usage.</p>

                            although it is unknown whether that date refers to the beginning or the end of the latter project. Here, too, are found the miniscule lettering, 
                            the punctuation ending each line until it doesn&#x02BC;t, and the line numbering on the left. The punctuation is frequently bizarre, 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#JREUSODIA">&#x201C;Eudosia&#x201D;</title> uniquely displaying a mark formed from two horizontal dots, like a colon on its side or a two&#x2014;point ellipsis. 
                            This mark does not appear in <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>, where all the colons are right&#x2014;side up, but the semicolons are upside&#x2014;down,

                                catalogue of the constellations, a versification of a novel, and &#x201C;a poem on the universe&#x201D;. Inevitably left incomplete 
                                in the latter two cases, the projects mark <date when="1828">1828</date> as a year of confident wielding of the pen. <!--<title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201c;Eudosia&#x201d;</title>

                            <p>An especially valuable feature of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title> fair copy is the evidence of <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s participation in its process. 
                                At line 54 of the poem, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s handwriting can be unmistakably identified. The intervention is a penciled correction of a mistranscription of a word from the draft text, 
                                substituting the word &#x201C;bear&#x201D; for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s erroneously copied &#x201C;appear&#x201D;. The insertion is accompanied by a penciled deletion of &#x201C;appear&#x201D; using a style of strikethrough that differs from all other instances of strikethrough, save one at line 30 
                                (see the textual gloss hanging from line 54, <!--ref tag--><ref type="gloss_contextual" target="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#MONOCEROSGLOSS">&#x201C;The horn the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MONOCEROS">unicorn</name> doth appear&#x201D;</ref>). 
                                From this evidence, one may infer that a series of other pencil marks on the manuscript&#x2014;a diagonal or double diagonal line at the end of each line of verse&#x2014;records 
                                <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s proofreading of the fair copy against the draft manuscript. That these diagonal marks were <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s is substantiated by their replacement by &#x00D7; marks next to certain lines of verse, 
                                which evidently signaled her concerns, prompting revisions by <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>. It is possible that the marks were made by <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, 
                                but his handwriting does not otherwise appear in the manuscript.</p>
                            
                            <p>While we can only infer <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s objections based on the content of the original verse and on <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s substitution, 
                                the topics that drew her censorship seem evident enough. The constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MEDUSACONSTELLATION">Medusa&#x02BC;s Head</name> must have seemed too horrible, 
                                so it was replaced by the modern wonder of the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#TELESCOPIUM">Telescope</name>, a constellation that also advantageously sponsored patriotism for its assocation 
                                with the British astronomer <persName corresp="#WHERSCHEL">William Herschel</persName> (<date notBefore="1738" notAfter="1822">1738&#x2013;1822</date>). Even the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LYNX">&#x201C;furious lynx&#x201D;</name> needed to be tamed to become only &#x201C;keen&#x2010;eyed&#x201D;. 
                                The religious associations with the constellation, the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ARA">Altar</name>, were dangerously pagan, so the epithet &#x201C;gods fire&#x201D; was added 
                                to lend a Biblical context. One change was demanded apparently to prevent a jest from disturbing the gravity of the subject; 
                                and some lines seem to have been assigned an &#x00D7; for no discernible reason other than poetic: the trite and redundant epithet &#x201C;pretty&#x201D; was rejected, 
                                and an imperfect rhyme needed mending <!-- links to glosses -->

                                first writing in cursive with a pencil, and then in some cases writing in cursive with pen and ink to revise the revision over top of the pencil.
                                Insofar as the available evidence shows, then, the revisions were invented by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>; no other hand is present in the draft revision, 
                                although of course we cannot know what discussion, if any, surrounded his decisions. We also cannot know for certain at what point in the fair&#x2010;copying 
                                the process of proofreading and marking for revision began. Since the poem is fair&#x2010;copied through the end of the extant <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> draft, 
                                it is reasonable to conclude that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> completed the fair&#x2010;copying before it was subjected to scrutiny, although some finishing touches are incomplete: 
                                the marginal line numbering halts after line 60, with fifteen remaining lines left unnumbered; and as already remarked, most punctuation, particularly at the ends of verse lines, 
                                is abandoned after about line 20. Perhaps at this final stage of touch&#x2010;up, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> (or perhaps <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> as well as <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>) 
                                intervened with a review. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may even have been surprised by the demand for revision. The manuscript is unique among the juvenilia 
                                as a fair copy that was subjected to a critique, resulting in revisions made on the fair copy itself.</p>
                            
                            <p>It may be no coincidence that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s marginal line&#x2010;numbering was arrested at line 60, since at lines 57&#x2013;60 the most extensive single passage 
                                is flagged for revision, with a long diagonal line and &#x00D7;s marking a quatrain about the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LIBRA">Libra (the Scales)</name>, ending in a mention of the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MILKYWAY">Milky Way</name>. 
                                The passage may have been flagged merely because the original lines, both in draft and fair copy, are somewhat incoherent: 
                                the lines develop a paradox of the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LIBRA">Scales</name> being capable of weighing &#x201C;nothing&#x201D; yet containing a &#x201C;thousand more&#x201D;&#x2014;more even than &#x201C;the beautiful <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MILKYWAY">milky way</name>&#x201D;&#x2014;but 
                                but with the implied object, <hi rend="italic">stars</hi>, being absent from the lines. The omission may or may not have been deliberate, 
                                but instead of revising to clarify the paradoxical conceit, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> substituted a couplet that veers to a different topic altogether&#x2014;<name type="astronomical" corresp="#LIBRA">the Scales</name> as a symbol of justice, 
                                a traditional treatment of this constellation, particularly in Roman astronomy (see the contextual gloss hanging from line 57, 
                                <ref type="gloss_contextual" target="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#LIBRAGLOSS">&#x201C;The scales that nothing to weigh would bear&#x201D;</ref>).</p> 
                            
                            <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> began the revision of the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LIBRA">Libra</name> quatrain in pencil at the bottom of the inner fold of the pamphlet, 
                                sprawling across the fold to the opposite recto, then blank (pp. 3&#x2013;4), and coninuing onto the back of the pamphlet (p. 4). Nine lines of cursive pencil text wrestle with the topic of justice 
                                (see the textual gloss hanging from lines 57&#x2013;60, <ref type="glosses_textual" target="constellations_glosses_textual.php#LIBRATEXTGLOSS">&#x201C;that nothing to weigh would bear / . . . / More than than the beautiful milky way&#x201D;</ref>); 
                                and then, at the bottom and top&#x2010;right of the inner fold (pp. 3&#x2013;4), he overwrote this pencil draft with pen and ink, still in cursive, 
                                recasting the lines on <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LIBRA">Libra</name> as the couplet they became in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> fair copy. 
                                Next, on remaining space in the middle of the inner recto (p. 3), and over top of pencil draft on the back (p. 4), 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drafted in pen and ink new lines on the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MILKYWAY">Milky Way</name> as they appear in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> fair copy (lines 65&#x2013;69).
                                In these new lines, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> expanded on the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MILKYWAY">Milky Way</name>, previously mentioned only as a comparison with what stars could be weighed in <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LIBRA">Libra</name>&#x02BC;s scales, 
                                and now elaborated as the myth of the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MILKYWAY">Milky Way</name> as a roadway to heaven. Revision on this larger scale toward the end of the poem 
                                engages with topics of justice and of pagan &#x201C;knowledge&#x201D; versus <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christian</orgName> &#x201C;virtue&#x201D;&#x2014;a seriousness of purpose that lends perspective

                             <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> exhibits no incorrectly formed marks, though only twenty lines carry any punctuation at all. 
                            Still, this correctness, combined with the prominence
                            
                            
                            
                            of poetry densely at the start of the poem, but abandoned punctuation later. 
                            Since the , suggesting that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> gradually lost interest in that feature of the fair copy; 
                            and in both, the punctuation is eccentric, his use of colons seeming more decorative than functional, although his rhetorical use of commas and periods 
                            seems marginally more coherent in the opening lines of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title> <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;Constellations&#x201D;</title> as compared with the opening lines 
                            of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;Monastery&#x201D;</title>. Presumably, though not certainly, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> made these revisions shortly before fair&#x2014;copying the revised text in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, 
                            perhaps in <date notBefore="1827-09" notAfter="1828-04">late 1827&#x2014;early 1828</date>. 
                            (thus, incidentally, representing one of the earliest datable examples of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s longhand script). 
                            In fact, the original fair copy in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>, and not just its revisions, may have only shortly predated the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version&#x2014;or 
                            at least the second page of the fair copy may have been significantly closer in time to the revisions. 
                            Starting at line 53 of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>, the fair&#x2010;copy hand suddenly appears larger, and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> abandons the line numbering in the margin&#x2014;suggestions perhaps that, 
                            at this point, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may already have decided to sacrifice this fair copy to revision (see also textual note for line 54).
                        
                            
                    
                        successfullyAnother copy of the poem in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand is represented at the <orgName corresp="#RUSKINLIBRARYLANCASTER">Ruskin Library</orgName> 
                        by a photograph of a Entitled <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;THE CONSTELLATIONS NORTHERN / SOME OF THE ZODIAC / AND SOME OF THE SOUTHERN&#x201D;</title>, 
                        the original manuscript in the photograph is otherwise unknown, as are the occasion and date of its original purpose. 
                        The most valuable information revealed about the original is that it presented a fair&#x2010;copy text that predated 
                        the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version. The <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title> text runs the full length of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version, 
                        but several lines, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> crossed out and replaced by revisions scrawled in the margins, are incorporated in their revised form into the text of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version.</p>
                    
                    
                
                <p>First, the photograph shows a neatly printed, ink fair copy, which runs the full
                    length of the poem, adhering to the text of <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS
                        IA</ref> at least from line 27, the first line currently extant. This fair
                    copy, moreover, improves the draft in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS
                        IA</ref> by capitalizing first letters of each line (and capitalizing the
                    entire first word of line 1); by punctiliously punctuating the end of each line,
                    through line 19 (after which end&#45;line punctuation is dropped); and by
                    inserting marginal line numbering at the left of the text.</p>
                <p>Next, the fair copy was used for revision, which appears to be represented in two
                    stages, first apparently in pencil and second in ink. Because the photograph can
                    show only relative darkness and texture of these insertions, the two stages
                    cannot always be definitively distinguished. It is unquestionable, however, that
                    the photograph shows a palimpsest since, in places, a dark ink hand overwrites a
                    much lighter hand, and under magnification the lighter hand shows the variable
                    texture of pencil stroke, and the darker hand the evenness of ink.</p>
                <p>Apparently in the first stage of this revision, someone using the lighter hand
                    marked the ends of lines with a short diagonal line (/), sometimes with a double
                    diagonal (//), but marked other lines with a cross (X), and the latter show
                    cancellations and insertions&#x02014;in the form of strikethrough and caret,
                    within the line; in the form of longhand insertion, in the margin. (Minor
                    variations occur in this pattern.) Presumably, the lines with Xs were flagged
                    for revision, but by whom, and whether by the same person who simultaneously or
                    subsequently wrote the insertion, one can only guess. On the whole, the marginal
                    insertions appear to be in pencil, the same color and texture as the diagonals
                    and Xs. The second stage of revision, insofar as it can be distinguished from
                    the first, appears to be represented by the ink overwriting. But the two stages
                    may be only apparent, and the actual sequence more complex.</p>
                <p>The longhand in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref> is somewhat
                    awkward, in keeping with the fact documented in family letters that Ruskin had
                    only recently started practicing longhand as well as the use of ink (see <ref
                        type="note" target="ruskinshand.html">Ruskin&#x02019;s Hand</ref>). It
                    is possible, however, that more than one hand is represented in the
                    revisions.</p>
                <p>There appear to be several possible reasons why the fair copy shown in <ref
                        type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref> was sacrificed to revision. Ruskin
                    may have felt that the fair&#45;copy was spoiled by the error in line 54,
                    which he ended with <hi rend="italic">appear,</hi> thus repeating the rhyme word
                    at the end of the previous line, in place of <hi rend="italic">bear,</hi> which
                    ends line 54 in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA</ref>, and to which he
                    returned in <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS III</ref>. Moreover, about the
                    same place, starting with with line 53 in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF
                        T70</ref>, the printing becomes noticeably larger, as if he was suddenly in
                    a hurry. Perhaps most importantly, two significant confusions arise in the sense
                    of the text at about this point.</p>
                <p>First, the pair of couplets starting at line 57 about the Scales and the Milky
                    Way, which made little sense in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA</ref>,
                    made even less sense in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref>; and
                    hence, lines 57&#x02013;60 of <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref>
                    are heavily scored through (and after line 60, Ruskin also stopped marginally
                    numbering the lines). First, it appears, Ruskin revised the first of these
                    couplets, concerning the scales, to arriving at the <ref type="mss"
                        target="3.html">MS III</ref> version (&#x0201C;The scales in which twas
                    vainly said / The crimes and virtues of men were weighed&#x0201D; [lines
                    57&#x02013;58]). Draft for these lines appear in ink draft at the bottom of
                    this sheet, overwriting an earlier, canceled pencil version (that earlier
                    version apparently still related the Scales to the Milky Way, but the lines are
                    largely illegible in the photograph).</p>
                <p>Then, in place of lines 59&#x02013;60 of <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF
                        T70</ref>, concerning the Milky Way, Ruskin composed five new lines and
                    inserted them as lines 65&#x02013;69 of <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS
                        III</ref>. The draft, which is worked out on both sides of the sheet
                    (including what would have been the blank p. 4 of the <ref type="mss"
                        target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref> folded fair copy), exhibits some tension
                    between an Evangelical assessment of pagan myths and the classical lines that
                    won out in <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS III</ref>. On p. 4, the
                    underwriting in pencil reads, &#x0201C;[to(?)] heaven but / not [to(?)] hell
                    [for when (?)] / they went to / place [I(?)] say [that then (?)] / they took
                    quite / a different way / and this is all that Ive to say about the beauty [(?)]
                    milky way.&#x0201D; Overwriting this are lines approximating, but not
                    identical to the <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS III</ref> version:
                    &#x0201C;which all their best and bravest trod / of heroes that their
                    countrys good / espoused and neer in angry mood / unto great jupiters blest
                    abode.&#x02019; The final version, in <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS
                        III</ref>, takes a middle way between the Christian piety of the pencil
                    draft and the classical patriotism of the ink draft: &#x0201C;But oh that
                    wonder of them all / Which milky way europeans call / And which the ancients
                    thought the road / Which all their best and bravest trod / Unto great Jupiters
                    blest abode.&#x0201D; (The first three lines of this version are worked out
                    in ink draft on p. 3 [inside spread, recto] of <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html"
                        >RF T70</ref>, &#x0201C;but oh that wonder of them all / which milky way
                    europeans call / and which the ancients thought the road.&#x0201D;)</p>
                <p>Another confusion toward the end of the <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF
                        T70</ref> fair copy (line 64, or line 62 in <ref type="mss" target="3.html"
                        >MS III</ref>), which may have contributed to Ruskin&#x02019;s giving up
                    this fair copy to revision, arose evidently from a muddle over the order of the
                    constellations, which failed to conform with the linear order of his <ref
                        type="note" target="catalog.html">catalog poem</ref>. Line 64 in the earlier
                    version, &#x0201C;I wish I had not observed the lyre,&#x0201D; harkened
                    back to line 17, &#x0201C;After that doth come the lyre.&#x0201D; At
                    both these points in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref>, a revision
                    about the &#x0201C;frightened hare&#x0201D; is entered in the margin,
                    which ultimately replaced line 17.</p>
                <p>The hand for these changes indicate a growing hurry and restlessness. As
                    suggested in Date, the evidence may point to hurried preparations for New
                    Year&#x02019;s.</p> -->

                        like other poems and prose by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> of <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1828">1826&#x2013;28</date> that mention the fixed stars 
                        and other astronomical phenomena, was composed in context of popular education in astronomy for adults and children 
                        in the <date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1834"> early nineteenth century</date> in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>, 
                        which is surveyed in <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="astronomy_note.php">Astronomical Education</ref>. 
                        Some of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s print sources connected with this broader educational trend can be identified definitively by means of references in

                        which also contains the second fair copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title>. 
                        Other sources remain conjectural, especially a &#x201C;lesson book&#x201D; on astronomy mentioned in 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III&#x201D;</title></ref>.</p>
                    
                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s purpose in <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> is more poetic than scientific, 
                        with his most original contribution to the catalogue of stars consisting in the descriptive epithets he assigns to each of the constellation names. 
                        In a note added to the poem belatedly in the compositional process, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> admits that his arrangement of constellation names is unsystematic 
                        with respect to the stars&#x02BC; actual positions in the sky, although it is possible that the apparently random ordering represents an imaginative act of spatial reasoning 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#PROJECT">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D; as a Poetic Project</ref>). The poem, in any case, 
                        is not entirely lacking in the influence of children&#x02BC;s scientific lessons in astronomy typical the period; 
                        and regardless of the aesthetic emphasis in <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title>, 
                        his known sources tell us that he had access to basic information such as the cause of the apparent positions of the constellations in the night sky relative to the revolutions of the earth, 
                        and the practical applications of this knowledge, such as navigating one&#x02BC;s way on a moonless night by finding the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#POLARIS">North Star</name>.</p>
                   
                    <p><!--Regarding the poem&#x02BC;s primary concern with poetic naming, it-->It is difficult to measure the extent of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s acquaintance with the historical and mythological associations 
                        with the constellations, since he ascribes some epithets that do not allude to the stories and omits epithets altogther 
                        from some other constellation names. The poem reveals some familiarity with myth, however, 
                        as in the story of the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MILKYWAY">Milky Way (Via Lactea)</name>, 
                        which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> uses to frame his conclusion to the second fair copy (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>): 
                        &#x201C;the ancients thought&#x201D; it &#x201C;the road / Which all their best and bravest trod / Unto great <persName type="fictional" corresp="#JUPITERGOD">Jupiters</persName> blest abode&#x201D;.</p>

                        was positioned following a period in <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1827">1826&#x2013;27</date> when he had begun to read

                        or shortly followed his reading of additional educational dialogues on astronomy, 
                        which pick up where the conversations in <title type="lesson" corresp="#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi></title> leave off&#x2014;namely,

                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself identifies his use of these latter sources for astronomical education in

                        whereas his reading of the rudimentary dialogues <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><title type="lesson" corresp="#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi></title></ref> 
                        is presumptive, based on evidence of his familiarity with this work in

                    <p>It is possible that this first stage of astronomical education, preceding and contemporaneous with the composition of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title>, 
                        also relied on one of the primers in astronomical science written for children in the first third of the century 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="astronomy_note.php#PRINTSOURCES-PRIMERS">Astronomical Education: Astronomical Primers for Children</ref>; 
                        This kind of text was more likely to emphasize memorization rather than dialogic exchange; and primers of the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> for young readers 
                        perhaps more emphatically staked the purpose of astronomical study in religious admiration rather than practical and scientific reasoning.</p>
                    
                    <p>By <date notBefore="1828" notAfter="1829">1828&#x2013;29</date>, one year beyond the composition, revision, and fair&#x2010;copying of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> recorded statistical astronomical information in his

                        which was typically found in sophisticated print sources known as <hi rend="italic">star atlases</hi>, 
                        although such information was also plagiarized from star atlases in the astronomical primers for young readers. 
                        The identity of this type of source or sources used by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> remains elusive 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="astronomy_note.php#PRINTSOURCES-ATLASES">Astromical Education: Star Atlases</ref>). 
                        Whatever the source, while <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s presentation of astronomical information in <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III&#x201D;</title> 
                        appears more informed and sophisticated than the simple naming in <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title>, 
                        &#x201C;<persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName>&#x02BC;s&#x201D; approach seems flat and pedantic compared to the energy and invention of the earlier poem.

                        Even in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s books, however, <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s tutors begin study of astronomy by directing their pupils&#x02BC; attention to the evening sky. 
                        To what extent, if any, might <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s composition of his poem have involved actual astronomical observation?</p>

                        might have chosen those planets as famously beautiful and striking celestial bodies with which to begin his poem

                        It is also possible that the particular alignment described in the poem&#x2014;<name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARSPLANET">Mars</name> visible on the ecliptic, with the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> setting on the horizon&#x2014;indicates an actual and datable observation.</p>

                        The digital star chart shows that <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> set in the late&#x2010;afternoon dusk of <date when="1828-04">April 1828</date>, preceded by <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name>; 
                        and as the weeks advanced, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> set later in the evening than <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>, which had vanished by sunset. 
                        A comparison of findings using the <title type="website" corresp="#SKYANDTELESCOPE"><hi rend="italic">Sky &#x0026; Telescope Interactive Sky Chart</hi></title> with the <title type="essay" corresp="#ASPINCALENDARIUM">Calendarium</title> identifies <date when="1828-04">April 1828</date>, therefore, 
                        as the period when the tracks of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARSPLANET">Mars</name> overlapped with a sighting of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>. According to the digital star chart, 
                        this configuration was never visible at dusk or nighttime in in <date when="1827">1827</date>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Tending to confirm these observations in the first quarter of the year, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> includes the southern constellation, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CRATER">Crater</name>, 
                        in the poem, which is visible from the latitude of <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> in the evening sky, annually from December through May. 
                        The poem also names southern constellations that cannot be viewed from the latitude of <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> at all, 
                        but <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s choice of these appears related to a sentiment for their legends. The choice of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CRATER">Crater</name> seems arbitrary 
                        other than its regular rising and setting in the southern sky, culminating in April (see <ref type="glosses" target="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#CRATERGLOSS"><name type="astronomical" corresp="#CRATER">Crater</name>, contextual gloss</ref>).</p>

                        the poem&#x02BC;s introductory lines, a possibility that aligns with the evidence in <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref> 
                        supporting the year <date when="1828">1828</date> as a probable period of composition or at least revision of the poem. 
                        (Since the partially surviving manuscript of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> draft lacks the opening lines, the possibility of an earlier date in <date when="1827">1827</date> for the inception of the poem remains open.)
                        April&#x2013;May was typically the period when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> prepared poems for his father&#x02BC;s birthday in May, 
                        thus suggesting an occasion as well as a terminus a quo for the start of either composition or revision of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Whether or not <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> looked up from his books to the sky for an inspiration to open his poem, 
                        he was also prompted to admiration of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> by <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>&#x02BC;s fictional character, 
                        <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy Merton</persName>, who, &#x201C;looking up to the sky . . . observed so remarkable a constellation, that he . . . begged to know the name&#x201D;. 
                        On learning it was called <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>, he &#x201C;was so delighted with the grandeur and beauty of this glorious constellation, 
                        that he could not help observing it, by intervals, all the evening; and he was surprised to see that it seemed to pass on, 
                        in a right line drawn from east to west; and that all the stars he had become acquainted with moved every night in the same direction&#x201D;. 
                        In the opening four lines of the poem, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> echoes the alliterative modifiers with which <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName> describes the experience of gazing at the constellations: 
                        &#x201C;&#x2018;I should think there would be a very great pleasure in observing such a number of <hi rend="italic">glorious</hi>, <hi rend="italic">glittering</hi> bodies as are now above us&#x2019;&#x201D;

                    <p>Following <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> goes on to name circumpolar constellations 
                        (lines 7&#x2013;14). As possible real sightings, it is striking that he begins with <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major (the Great Bear)</name>, 
                        which likewise tops the list for April in the <title type="essay" corresp="#ASPINCALENDARIUM">&#x201C;Calendarium Stellaris&#x201D;</title>, that constellation being positioned &#x201C;in the zenith&#x201D;.
                        Moreover, the &#x201C;lower star in the tail&#x201D; of the bear &#x201C;at about 65 degrees high&#x201D; is &#x201C;one of those called <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN"><hi rend="italic">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</hi></name>&#x2014;the next to be identified by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>,

                        An observer in <date when="1828-04">April 1828</date> could, however, easily have followed <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s cues by 
                        looking up from <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> setting in the west 
                        to trace the poem&#x02BC;s network of constellations overhead. Locating  in the center of the sky, 
                        the observer would find the &#x201C;pointer&#x201d; stars embedded in <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name> (which forms part of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major</name>), using these to trace a path &#x2014;all &#x201C;northern&#x201D;, as explained by the first part of the subtitle&#x2014;--> 
                        All six of the following constellations named in the poem were also visible in April, according to the <title type="essay" corresp="#ASPINCALENDARIUM">Calendarium</title>: 
                        <name type="astronomical" corresp="#DRACO">Draco (the Dragon)</name>, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#COMABERENICES">Coma Berenices (Berenice&#x02BC;s Hair)</name>, 
                        <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CORONABOREALIS">Corona Borealis (the Northern Crown)</name>, 
                        Cygnus (the Swan). <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSHEART">Cor Caroli (Charles&#x02BC;s Heart)</name>, and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MEDUSACONSTELLATION">Medusa&#x02BC;s Head</name>

                        Only with the Telescope does <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> depart from naming what he could actually have viewed overhead in <date when="1828-04">April 1828</date>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Hereafter in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, the sequence of constellations appears more erratic, with the repeated &#x201C;next comes&#x201D; 
                        ceasing necessarily to refer to star formations that are adjacent in the dome of the sky. 
                        In the second fair copy, in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                        forestalled objections by adding a note with a caveat: &#x201C;These constellations though they are next in this poetry are not next in the sky&#x201d;. 
                        The note is not attached by an asterisk to a particular line in the poem, seeming to refer to the whole, 
                        so it is unclear whether he would have exempted the first fourteen lines from observable phenomena.

                        As a list, the poem shares some characteristics with an astronomical primer,

                        by <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName> (<date notBefore="1775" notAfter="1851">1775&#x2013;1851</date>). 
                        While no record of this book or a work like it is recorded in the Ruskin family library, <persName corresp="#MSS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName> introduces the topic of the constellations 
                        with a heading identical to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s main title, 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title>, 
                        and follows that heading with subdivisions, each with its own heading, that sorts the constellations 
                        into &#x201C;Constellations in the Zodiac or Ecliptic&#x201D;, &#x201C;Constellations to the North of the Ecliptic&#x201D;, 
                        and &#x201C;Constellations to the South of the Ecliptic&#x201D;&#x2014;subdivisions that resemble <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s subtitle to his poem, 
                        &#x201C;Northern, Some of the Zodiac, and Some of the Southern&#x201D;.</p>
                    
                    <p>In each of these subdivisions, <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName> 
                        merely lists the names of constellations&#x2014;the Latin name followed by its English translation&#x2014;which 
                        matches <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s procedure in his catalogue poem, except for his added embellishment of a poetic epithet to describe each constellation. 
                        <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName> provides no information about each of the constellations; rather, she annotates the respective lists with a Bible verse 
                        that mentions the stars and praises the <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#CREATOR">Creator</persName>

                    <p>As a catalogue poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> perhaps reflects <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName>&#x02BC;s pedagogical assumption that a child&#x02BC;s act of naming and identifying heavenly bodies precedes 
                        understanding of the physical laws that govern their motion and developing of the spatial imagination required to grasp the relation of the earth&#x02BC;s revolutions to the apparent movement of the constellations across the sky. 
                        Perhaps the poem is most accurately viewed as a tension between a framework of memorization and an exploration of poetic and spatial understanding. The poem is also less conspicuously religious in its initial form, 
                        and then confronts tensions between religion and legend or history in revision.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> makes a point of naming constellations with British associations, 
                            including Herschel's Telescope and the Carolingian constellations, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSHEART">Cor Caroli (Charles&#x02BC;s Heart)</name> and

                            requiring a plunge into southern constellations invisible to British viewers. 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> names not only these but also the more recent <name type="astronomical" corresp="#TELESCOPIUM">Telescopium Herschelii (<persName corresp="#WHERSCHEL">Herschell</persName>&#x02BC;s telescope)</name>. 
                            He also lends an English inflection to constellation names where possible: for example, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#APUS">Apus</name> is not the tropical Bird of Paradise 
                            but the northern Swallow; <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEO">Leo</name> is not the fierce Nemean Lion but the &#x201C;generous&#x201D; and therefore, one supposes, British kingly beast

                    <p>A similar sentiment may lie behind <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName>&#x02BC;s design in

                        of dividing the lists of constellation names between ancient and modern constellations&#x2014;those with British associations being numbered only among the modern. 
                            Of these, however, she names only the two <date notBefore="1600" notAfter="1699">seventeenth&#x2010;century</date> Carolingian inventions;  
                        and her design may have been equally animated by a wariness of pre&#x2010;Christian star legends.</p>
                    
                    <p>British jealousy of the nation&#x02BC;s standing in astronomy was aroused by competition with the French. 
                        In <title type="book" corresp="#ASPINASTRONOMY"><hi rend="italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</hi></title> (2d ed., <date when="1825">1825</date>) <persName corresp="#JASPIN">Aspin</persName> mocked an attempt to rename a portion of the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> after <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName> (see <ref type="glosses" target="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#ORIONGLOSS"><name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>, contextual gloss</ref>). 
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>An indirect expression of British pride of astronomical science may have animated <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s choice of constellations named after animals. 
                        An obvious example is Leo (the Lion), to which Ruskin assigned the epithet "generous". 
                        During the poem's composition, even greater excitement surrounded the giraffe, 
                        the origin of the constellation Camelopardalis. In 1827-28, the first living specimen of a giraffe 
                        was imported to Britain, an event that spurred competition with France, which also received a specimen 
                        (see Camelopardalis, contextual gloss). Overall, Ruskin's choice of several constellations named for animals 
                        may have been prompted by the opening of the London Zoo in March 1828.</p>

                    <p>While <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName> cannot avoid the mythical names of the constellations, she suppresses the myths themselves, 
                        defining the constellations neutrally as &#x201C;remarkable groups or clusters of stars, to which names of various figures have been given&#x201D;. 
                        She does not pursue the identity of the figures or their stories, presumably fearing that a fascination with the myths approaches idolatry, 
                        as suggested by a quotation from <title type="scripture" corresp="#CHRONICLES">Chronicles</title>:

                        directs admiration of the stars toward Christian praise: &#x201C;We find in Scripture the glory of the righteous in the resurrection compared to that of the stars; 
                        by which comparison we find, that their splendour will partake of that of the Son of God himself&#x201;

                        Modern ephemerides were based on exacting observations and mathematical computations, which were the pride of scientifically advanced nations that produced these star catalogues. It has been argued, 
                        however, that their forbidding tables made the ephemerides a &#x201C;primary culprit&#x201D; in driving away public interest in astronomy, 
                        displacing the appeal to popular imagination that the stars had presented in the annual almanacs with a professionalization of the science t

                    the very mention by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MEDUSACONSTELLATION">Medusa</name>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;dread&#x201D; decapitated head 
                        approaches that myth closely, compared to the vagueness or irrelevance of most of his other epithets considered as condensing the stories of the constellations. 
                        Thus, this clue suggests a source that made the pagan myths available, although <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> avoided alluding to those stories and suppressed&#x2014;or

                    <p>As a less exacting task, <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>&#x02BC;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName> contrives a paper globe on which 
                        <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYTD">Harry</persName> can draw the constellations

                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem can perhaps be viewed as an ersatz globe, listing constellation names in a sequence that oscillates back and forth from west to east and back again, or that possibly (in places) circles counter&#x2014;clockwise&#x2014;a pattern, 
                        if he intended any pattern at all, that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> could have plotted only by referencing a celestial globe or illustrated star charts in a book.</p>
                    
                    <p>One can test this theory by searching for a pattern in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s sequence of constellations. 
                        At line 12, following the circumpolar constellations, the next listed constellation is <name type="astonomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus (the Swan)</name>. 
                        Assuming, for consistency&#x02BC;s sake, the hour of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>&#x02BC;s setting in the west in <date when="1828-04">April 1828</date>, <name type="astonomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus</name> would have lain on the northeast horizon, beyond <name type="astronomical" corresp="#DRACO">Draco</name>. 
                        Then the following item, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSHEART">Cor Caroli (Charles&#x02BC;s Heart)</name> would have directed the viewer back toward the center of the dome, 
                        within <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CANESVENATICI">Canes Venatici (Hunting Dogs)</name>, between <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#COMABERENICES">Coma Berenices</name>. 
                        For the next, the now obsolete constellation, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#TELESCOPIUM"><persName corresp="#WHERSCHEL">Herschell</persName>&#x02BC;s Telescope</name>, one would have turned back toward the west, 
                        where it would have been rising as <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> was setting, located within <name type="astronomical" corresp="#AURIGA">Auriga (the Charioteer)</name>. 
                        The next, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#EQUULEUS">Equuleus (Little Horse)</name>, is found between <name type="astronomical" corresp="#PEGASUSCONSTELLATION">Pegasus</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#DELPHINUS">Delphinus</name>, 
                        which would have lain back toward <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus</name>, rising on the northeast horizon as the evening advanced on April 28. The next named constellation, the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ANSER">Goose (Anser)</name>, does keep within range of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#EQUULEUS">Equuleus</name>; 
                        however, to get from <name type="astronomical" corresp="ANSER">Goose</name> to <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEPUS">Hare</name>&#x2014;<name type="astronomical" corresp="#ANSER">Anser</name> to <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEPUS">Lepus (hare)</name>&#x2014;again sends one in the opposite direction, to the feet of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>.</p>
                    
                    <p>At this point in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title> draft, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> originally cited <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LYRA">Lyra (the Lyre)</name>, which he replaced with <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEPUS">Lepus (Hare)</name>. 
                        Since <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LYRA">Lyra</name> is found in the same quadrant as <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ANSER">Anser</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus</name>, by substituting <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEPUS">Hare</name>, which lies at <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>&#x02BC;s feet, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> maintained a pattern of back&#x2010;and&#x2010;forth, west&#x2010;to&#x2010;east and back again (or counter&#x2010;clockwise circling), but in naming <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEPUS">Hare</name> he also 
                        dropped below the celestial equator to &#x201C;some of the southern&#x201D; constellations, as his title mentions. A few lines later, he will plunge into the corresponding southern constellations 
                        on the opposite side with <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CRUX">Crux (Southern Cross)</name>. It seems to break the pattern that, intervening between these southern constellations, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> lists <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMINOR">Ursa Minor (Lesser Bear)</name>, 
                        which contains the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#POLARIS">Pole Star</name>, but perhaps he paused midway across the sky only to rhyme <hi rend="italic">hare</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bear</hi>. 
                        He may also have wanted <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMINOR">Ursa Minor</name>. to stand as a barrier between <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ANSER">Anser</name>, &#x201C;stupid goose&#x201D;, and &#x201C;cunning fox&#x201D; (<name type="astronomical" corresp="#VULPECULAETANSER">Vulpecula</name>), 
                        which follows <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMINOR">Ursa Minor</name> in the list. Traditionally, Fox and Goose were treated as a single constellation, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VULPECULAETANSER">Vulpecula et Anser</name>, 
                        with the Goose caught in the Fox&#x02BC;s mouth (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><persName corresp="#IRIDPATH">Ridpath</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><hi rend="italic">Star Tales</hi></title></ref>, 182&#x2013;83). 
                        By separating them, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> characteristically avoided violence.</p>
                    
                    <p>It seems a fool&#x02BC;s errand to look for an equivalent of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName>&#x02BC;s paper globe 
                        in what <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself characterized as a poetic order&#x2014;&#x201C;constellations . . . next in this poetry . . . not next in the sky&#x201d;. 
                        Whatever poetic idea directed his eye (and intriguingly, governed his choices for revision) in moving from constellation to constellation, 
                        the most dramatic poetic evolution of the poem lay in the addition and revision of the poem&#x02BC;s conclusion in the two fair copies. 
                        For this development, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have looked neither to a real nor a paper sky, 
                        but to a theatrical projection.</p>
                </div>
                        
                        <p>As <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem clicks along, however, while repeating &#x201c;next&#x201D; and &#x201c;next&#x201D; 
                            the sequence becomes erratic. As suggested by the poem&#x02BC;s title, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears to have extended belatedly in order to account for &#x201C;some of the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ZODIAC">zodiac</name> and some of the southern&#x201D; constellations 
                            that had found their way into the poem along with the survey of the visible &#x201C;northern&#x201D; sky (see <ref type="intenal" target="#TITLE">Title</ref>), the sequence reveals a logic at best only intermittently 
                            (see <ref type="internal" target="#REAL-LIFE">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D; as a Record of Actual Astronomical Observations</ref>). Aware of the systematic procedure advised by his books&#x02BC; astronomy lessons, he added the caveat, 
                            &#x201C;These constellations though they are next in this poetry are not next in the sky&#x201d;, 
                            to the second and final fair copy (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>). Whatever led his fancy, the poem is livelier 
                            than <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName>&#x02BC;s bare and wooden lists set up alongside Bible verses for rote memorization.</p></div>
                            
                            <div>
                            
                            
                            
                            
                            <p>In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, the largely random order in which the constellations are named 
                                suggests that he had so far neglected understanding of these basic astronomical concepts, and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName>&#x02BC;s drills a year later 
                                in <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III&#x201D;</title> indicate limited advance since the lessons only double the memorization task. 
                                While the poem begins logically by naming &#x201C;northern&#x201D; constellations, fixing on the familiar circumpolar group, 
                                thereafter the sequence darts around the celestial globe, naming &#x201C;some&#x201D; in the north, &#x201C;some&#x201D; in the south, and &#x201C;some&#x201D; in the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ZODIAC">zodiac</name>. 
                                Associative connections, if any, are thematic rather than scientific, such as his abrupt plunges into the southern hemisphere, motivated apparently by a patriotic desire to name a constellation that bears a British association 
                                (see <ref type="internal" target="#EDUCATION">Patriotic Astronomical Education</ref>). Occasionally the sequence of naming is clustered within a circumscribed region of the sky, 
                                but on the whole <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> subordinates scientific logic to aesthetic pleasure. As he declares in a caveat added as a note to the second fair copy (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>): 
                                &#x201C;These constellations though they are next in this poetry are not next in the sky&#x201d;.</p>
                            
                            <p>The belated addition of that note to the second fair copy does suggest, however, that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was at least gaining awareness of what he lacked in basic understanding of astronomical science. 
                                <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName>&#x02BC;s memorization drills in <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III&#x201D;</title> are dull 
                                compared to dreaming up poetic epithets in <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title>, 
                                but the constellation lists in <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title> follow a more organized pattern compared to the poem&#x02BC;s random naming, proceeding generally from the north to the south on the celestial globe. 
                                This gain in organization, while revealing little about what <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have learned conceptually over the intervening year about astronomical science, 
                                perhaps registers a tempering of aesthetic glee with systematic learning. The approach remains invested in the memorization exercises
                                for  lacks the specifically religious aims and praise of the <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#CREATOR">Creator</persName> 
                                emphasized in <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName>&#x02BC;s scheme, the poem does share with her primer an emotional stir, 
                                and even that enthusiasm seems to drop out of the later lessons for <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName>. Perhaps <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s astronomical education remained conflicted 
                                over the problem that arose when revising the poem&#x02BC;s conclusion in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title> fair copy. 
                                In the revisions to the first fair copy, the praise of &#x201C;virtue&#x201D;&#x2014;the closest that <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> comes to <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName>&#x02BC;s praise of the <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#CREATOR">Creator</persName> in scripture quotations&#x2014;is 
                                bound up with a problem of how to reconcile &#x201C;history&#x201D; with Christian &#x201C;knowledge&#x201D;; and &#x201C;history&#x201D; appears to have included familiarity with pagan myth, which <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> flagged with &#x00D7;s to be replaced or revised. 
                                One year later, in <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . .

                                points out <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC; Wain</name> in the night sky, and describes the formation using the diagram&#x2014;four stars forming a wagon, and three stars making the horses, 
                                all of them also forming part of a larger constellation, the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMAJOR">Great Bear or Ursa Major</name>. This constellation, he explains, can serve as a compass for finding one&#x02BC;s bearings at night, 
                                without the sun&#x02BC;s position to define east and west. As a northern, circumpolar constellation, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC; Wain</name> is always visible on a clear night; 
                                and as the diagram shows, it points to the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#POLARIS">North Star (i.e., Polaris)</name> if one traces a line upward through the two stars forming the rear end of the wagon. 
                                From this first point of reference, the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TUTORJJ">Tutor</persName> proceeds to instruct <persName type="fictional" corresp="#CHARLESJJ">Charles</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#JAMESJJ">James</persName> in the names and locations of other stars, constellations, and planets

                                Just so, in <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></title>, the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TUTORJJ">Tutor</persName> instructs his pupils,

                                in the tactic of starting from a prominent point of reference in the sky, although not, in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s case, with a constellation, but with a planet, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name>, the so&#x2010;called Morning Star and Evening Star, 
                                which is a wandering rather than a fixed star. &#x201C;Dost thou see&#x201D;, the poem asks, how <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> is associated with the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> 
                                as these bodies fall below the horizon in the west? From there, the poem turns to the next planet on the ecliptic, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARS">Mars</name>, 
                                and then re&#x2010;orients to the circumpolar constellations overhead. The method does not adopt <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy Sandford</persName>&#x02BC;s more practical and reliable recommendation of first finding <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name> and then tracing its pointer stars to the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#NORTHSTAR">Pole Star</name>; 
                                instead, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s sequence starts from &#x201C;stars&#x201D; traditionally regarded as the most beautiful&#x2014;the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUS">Evening Star</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion&#x02BC;s Belt</name>, 
                                &#x201C;a glorious sight for all sky loving men&#x201D;&#x2014;and thence carries on to the circumpolar formations. From this more sublimely oriented beginning, the poem does proceed to follow <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName>&#x02BC;s advice, 
                                that &#x201C;by remembering these stars [of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name>], you may very easily observe those which are next to them, and learn their names too, till you are acquainted with the whole face of the heavens&#x201D;

                              -->  As <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem clicks along, however, while repeating &#x201c;next&#x201D; and &#x201c;next&#x201D; 
                                the sequence becomes erratic. As suggested by the poem&#x02BC;s title, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears to have extended belatedly in order to account for &#x201C;some of the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ZODIAC">zodiac</name> and some of the southern&#x201D; constellations 
                                that had found their way into the poem along with the survey of the visible &#x201C;northern&#x201D; sky (see <ref type="intenal" target="#TITLE">Title</ref>), the sequence reveals a logic at best only intermittently 
                                (see <ref type="internal" target="#REAL-LIFE">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D; as a Record of Actual Astronomical Observations</ref>). Aware of the systematic procedure advised by his books&#x02BC; astronomy lessons, he added the caveat, 
                                &#x201C;These constellations though they are next in this poetry are not next in the sky&#x201d;, 
                                to the second and final fair copy (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>). Whatever led his fancy, the poem is livelier

                                In <date when="1828">1828</date>, if they had acquired <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="lesson" corresp="#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Celestial Atlas</hi></title>, its exercises would surely have demanded too much of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s abilities. As 
                                remarked previously, the random order in which he names constellations in his poem suggests that he failed to master even the most basic astronomical concepts,  
                                as presented in <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName>&#x02BC;s elementary primer. </p>
                            
                            <p>Still, a confirmed source of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s exposure to the mythology of the constellations remains elusive, as does a measure of his knowledge of those stories.

                                How familiar this information would have been to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself in this period is unknown.</p>
                            
                            <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem leaves one guessing even about his knowledge of mythology, however, 
                                since he invests each constellation with an epithet that lends a poetic coloring without necessarily alluding to its mythological associations (and sometimes contradicting or deflecting from the commonly associated stories).

                            <p>Even as educational entertainments for children, however, the Lenten astronomy lectures were regarded

                                his parents take him and his cousin <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MARYME">Mary</persName> to an astronomy lecture at a theater. The performance 
                                features something like the large&#x2014;scale, illuminated or &#x201C;transparent&#x201D; stage orreries with Greek&#x2014;inspired names like <hi rend="italic">Eidouranion</hi>, 
                                which combined the older mechanical, three&#x2014;dimensional orrery that reproduced the revolutions of the sun and planets 
                                with transparancies projected by a magic lantern (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUANGURANIA"><persName corresp="#H-FHUANG">Huang</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HUANGURANIA">&#x201C;When Urania Meets Terpsichore&#x201D;</title></ref>, 49&#x2013;51, 66 n. 23). 
                                For <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>, criticism of these spectacles pertains not just to quack lecturers and creaky, dysfunctional orreries, 
                                which <persName corresp="#H-FHUANG">Huang</persName> finds in satires of the day (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUANGURANIA"><title type="essay" corresp="#HUANGURANIA">&#x201C;When Urania Meets Terpsichore&#x201D;</title></ref>, 62&#x2013;63); more fundamentally,

                                &#x201C;particularly interesting to <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName>&#x201D; thanks only to &#x201C;the pains he had taken, and the various attempts he had made,

                                and &#x201C;even he&#x201D;, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName>, &#x201C;after all his reading in <title type="book" corresp="#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></title>, had much difficulty sometimes in understanding both the machine and the lecturer&#x201D;. 
                                <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s most severe criticism is aimed at the failure to scale knowledge to the age&#x2014;appropriate accessibility of young listeners. 
                                The lecturer overwhelms the audience &#x201C;with a vast number of words, which&#x201D; <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> &#x201C;strained his attention&#x201D; to understand,

                                    but embedded in a peroration on the infinitude of the universe: &#x201C;. . . how in adequate must the utmost stretch of finite faculties be to represent infinity! 
                                    The stars, disposed in constellations, and surrounded by concentric circles, may perhaps assist the imagination a little: 
                                    The attempt in the <title type="lesson" corresp="#WALKERLASTSCENE">LAST SCENE</title>, if not admired, we hope will be forgiven. But was it possible we could actually take our flight 
                                    into infinite space, or be borne on the wings of lightning, to the most distant fixed Star we can now see, even there, 
                                    perhaps we should find ourselves on the confines of creation, and see as many stars before us as we left behind! 
                                    For space has neither top nor bottom in it; it is a circle whose centre is every where, but whose circumference is no where!&#x201D; (pp. 36&#x2013;37).</item>

                            <p>According to this description, the <title type="lesson" corresp="#WALKERLASTSCENE">&#x201C;Last Scene&#x201D;</title>, at least as delivered by the Walker family, 
                                which by <date when="1828">1828</date> had passed into the management of <persName corresp="#DFW">Deane Franklin Walker</persName> (<date notBefore="1778" notAfter="1865">1778&#x2013;1865</date> [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUANGURANIA"><persName corresp="#H-FHUANG">Huang</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HUANGURANIA">&#x201C;When Urania Meets Terpsichore&#x201D;</title></ref>, 50]), 
                                the most comprehensive view of the constellations was presented as the finale. Could <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> have conceived of his poem 
                                as an ekphrastic version of this final, totalizing scene? Apparently, in this show, a transparency 
                                exhibited a circle of the starry night, surrounded by concentric rings to suggest infinitude. 
                                In an engraving by <persName corresp="#ISTOW">I. Stow</persName> (ca. <date notBefore="1770" notAfter="1823">1770&#x2013;1823</date>), after <persName corresp="#EBURNEY">E. F.

                                Scene 1 represented the earth and sun by turning the orbit vertically to the audience, enclosing this revolution of the Eidouranion within a projection of an outer ring, which showed the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ZODIAC">Zodiac</name> constellations. 
                                The <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ZODIAC">Zodiac</name> constellations were represented by their respective mythological figures. 
                                Perhaps the transparency for the Last Scene exhibited a similar ring of constellations in their mythological guise,
                                which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in his way has reproduced.</p>
                            
                            <p>The beginning of the poem, however, starts with a version of Scene 1 in the Walkers&#x02BC; exhibition&#x2014;or more precisely, a portion of their Scene 4&#x2014;with 
                                the rising and setting of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARS">Mars</name>. As noted earlier, the poem is atypical of <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                                introductions to the constellations, which begin with finding the circumpolar constellations in the sky. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                                incorporates that observation as the second stage of his poem. The <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ZODIAC">Zodiac</name> constellations form a distinct piece within the poem. 
                                The most significant point to draw from the context of the Lenten astronomy lectures is that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s catalogue 
                                may have attempted a sublime totality, an expression of religious awe.</p>
