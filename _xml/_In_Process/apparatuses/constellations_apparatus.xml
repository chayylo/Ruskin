                        Its placement after the second volume of <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL2">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title> 
                        and before <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHESUN">&#x201C;The Sun&#x201D;</title> suggests <date when="1828-01-01">New Year&#x02BC;s 1828</date>. 
                        Indeed, in the prose section of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> preceding the poem, 
                        <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> gives <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName> 
                        a drawing of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name> &#x201C;as an introduction to astronomy&#x201D;. 
                        Thus, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s editors are strictly correct in listing the poem under <date when="1827">1827</date>&#x2014;that is, 
                        composition in late <date when="1827">1827</date> for a <date when="1828-01-01">New Year&#x02BC;s 1828</date> presentation.</p>
                    <p>The editors seem to intend earlier <date when="1827">1827</date>, associating the poem with the rough draft of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title> 
                        in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, which they misdate as <date when="1827">1827</date>. 
                        If they based their dating on harder evidence contained in the rough draft of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;Constellations&#x201D;</title> 
                        in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 2:535), 
                        their reasoning cannot be confirmed or denied, since a piece of that rough draft manuscript is now very likely missing.
                        The evidence in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> does hold open a possibility for an earlier date. 
                        As noted in nos. 1 and 4, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> seems habitually to have included his previous year&#x02BC;s presentation poems 
                        along with the most recent New Year&#x02BC;s gift in his <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title> books 
                        (e.g., in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> includes another older New Year&#x02BC;s poem, no. 4, in this group). 
                        Thus, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> could have existed as a New Year&#x02BC;s gift for <date when="1827">1827</date>, 
                        although no positive evidence supports the possibility.</p>
                    <p>If the poem is based on Ruskin's actual observation of the sky, the alignment of heavenly bodies described at the beginning 
                        of the poem would not have been possible in 1827, not even as late as December for a New Year's composition. In that case,
                        the composition would have to be moved forward to April-May 1828, more in keeping with the occasion of John James's birthday.

                    <p>A separate presentation copy of the poem is represented at the <orgName corresp="#RUSKINLIBRARYLANCASTER">Ruskin Library</orgName> 
                        by a photograph of a manuscript, taken for the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> but unused 
                        (RF T70; for its physical description, see part 2, MS IA, &#x201C;Contents,&#x201D; b). 
                        The location of the original manuscript is unknown, as are the occasion and date of its presentation, 
                        and its physical characteristics, other than its consisting of a single folded sheet. 
                        Entitled <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;THE CONSTELLATIONS NORTHERN / SOME OF THE ZODIAC / AND SOME OF THE SOUTHERN&#x201D;</title>, 
                        the photograph shows a fair&#x2010;copy version predating the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> fair copy. 
                        It runs the full length of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version, 
                        but several lines are crossed out and revisions scrawled in the margins&#x2014;revisions that all appear in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version, 
                        excepting a word or two that were altered again for that final version. The revisions are written in an awkward longhand, 
                        unlike the tiny print lettering of the fair copy.
                        Presumably, the RF T70 revisions were made shortly before the <date notBefore="1827-09" notAfter="1828-04">late 1827&#x2014;early 1828</date> fair copy 
                        in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> (thus, incidentally, representing one of the earliest datable examples of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s longhand script). 
                        In fact, the RF T70 fair copy itself, and not just its revisions, may have only shortly predated the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version. 
                        At line 53 of RF T70, the fair&#x2010;copy hand suddenly becomes larger and more careless, suggesting that, at this point, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> decided to sacrifice this fair copy to revision (see also textual note for line 54).
                        On the last page of the folded sheet (i.e., p. 4) in the photograph, revised lines of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> 
                        appear to be written over top of a lighter script of lines that I am unable to connect definitely with any extant fair&#x2010;copy juvenilia: 
                        &#x201C;[to(?)] heaven but / not [to(?)] hell [for when (?)] / they went to / place [I(?)] say [that then (?)] / they took quite / a different way / and . . .&#x201D; 
                        (the writing continues for four more, illegible lines). The scrawled draft suggests notes for a sermon, although it might represent attempted revision of 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> since some lines were given a more pious cast in the final version 
                        (see, e.g., the textual notes for the lines &#x201C;The scales in which twas vainly said / The crime and virtues of men were weighed,&#x201D; and for the closing meditation on the superiority of virtue to knowledge). 
                        No surviving fair&#x2010;copy lines, however, even remotely match the faint draft.</p>
                </div>
                <div type="section" xml:id="DISCUSSION">
                    <head type="section">Discussion</head>
                    <p>Evidence of one source of Ruskin's reading about the constellations is revealed in "Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2", 
                        where Harry offers to "give . . . [Lucy] a drawing of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">charles&#x02bc;s wain</name> 
                        as an introduction to astronomy". The drawing, which he shows in the text, reproduces a diagram in volume 2, 
                        "Of Astronomy", of Jeremiah Joyce's Scientific Dialogues (2:250 opp. [pl. 1, fig. 1]). 
                        In Joyce's dialogue, the Tutor shows this diagram to his pupils, Charles and James, just as Ruskin's Harry presents the drawing to Lucy,
                        as a first step in learning "'how to distinguish the stars, and . . . call them by their proper names'". 
                        He points out Charles' Wain in the night sky, and illustrates the formation with the diagram--four stars forming a waggon, and three stars making the horses, 
                        which are part of a larger constellation, the Great Bear--as a means to finding one's bearings at night, 
                        without the sun's position to define the cardinal points of the compass. As a northern constellation, Charles' Wain is always visible on a clear night; 
                        and as the diagram shows, it can be used to point to the North Star (i.e., Polaris) by tracing a line traced through the top of the waggon. 
                        From this first point of reference, the Tutor proceeds to instruct Charles and James in the names and locations of other stars, constellations, and planets 
                        (coversation 2, "Of the Fixed Stars", Scientific Dialogues, 2:12-18).</p>
                    <p>Ruskin's poem, "The Constellations", effectively forms Lucy's "introduction to astronomy", corresponding to the Tutor's subsequent instruction of Charles and James 
                        in the names and positions of the constellations. The poem adopts the Tutor's tactic of starting from a prominent point of reference, 
                        in this case a planet, a wandering rather than a fixed star--Venus, the so-called Morning Star and Evening Star. 
                        Ruskin's poem works more simply than Joyce's conversations, by presenting a mere catalogue of constellations, 
                        whereas the Tutor leads his pupils from the diagram of Charles' Wain to a celestial globe, on which they can map what they see in the sky, 
                        and orient the constellations to the ecliptic and equator; and then he teaches them to consult an <hi rend="italic">ephemeris</hi> 
                        or almanac of the longitudes and latitudes, times of rising and setting, and other information about the heavenly bodies.</p>
                    <p>Ruskin possibly built his simpler catalogue of constellations based on actual observation of Venus, 
                        just as Joyce initially situates his fictional characters observing the evening sky at the end of a lingering walk. 
                        According to a digital-age ephemeris, Venus would have been visible from London as an evening star, 
                        setting in the west and appearing close to Orion's belt, in April-May 1828. Mars would not have been visible high in the sky precisely at that time, 
                        but would have risen from the east somewhat later, after Venus had set. This particular configuration of planets and constellations 
                        would not have appeared at any other time in 1828, and not at all in 1827. During those two months in 1828--the time when Ruskin 
                        would have been composing poetry for his father's birthday--the northern constellations could be viewed circling counter-clockwise overhead, 
                        in roughly the sequence listed in the poem--Ursa Major (the Great Bear), 
                        Draco (the Dragon), Corona Borealis (the Crown), Coma Berenices (Berenice's Hair). 
                        Beyond this point in Ruskin's list, the sequence is jumbled compared to what one would have seen in the sky, 
                        having to dart in different directions to find Cygnus (the Swan); 
                        Charles's Heart, which is a star in Canes Venatici (Hunting Dogs); and so on 
                        (Sky &#x0026; Telescope, Interactive Star Chart and Celestial Almanac, accessed 20 March 2022). 
                        Of course, if based on any actual observation at all, Ruskin's poem reflect experience mixed with information gleaned from a book or globe.</p>
                    <p>A distinct difference between Ruskin's poem and Joyce's dialogue is that Ruskin is interested in the poetic images evoked by the mythic names, whereas 
                        Joyce's Tutor and his scholars are dismissive of what they regard as largely humbug: "<hi rend="italic">James</hi>. 
                        'Why are the signs of the Zodiac called by the several names of Aries, Taurus, Leo, &#x0026;c. 
                        I see no likeness in the heavens to Rams, or Bulls, or Lions, which are the English words for those Latin ones'. 
                        <hi rend="italic">Tutor</hi>. 'Nor do I'" (conversation 4, "Of the Ephemeris", Scientific Dialogues, 2:36-37).</p>
                    <p>One lesson that Joyce's Tutor dwells on is the arbitrariness underlying the naming systems of astronomy. 
                        The imagined patterns in the sky, whereby the Greek ordered and named the constellations, were arbitrary constructions. As the Tutor emphasizes: 
                        "'The ancients, that they might the better distinguish and describe the stars, with regard to their situation in the heavens, 
                        divided them into constellations, that is, systems of stars, each system consisting of such stars as were near to each other, 
                        giving them the names of such men or things, as they fancied the space which they occupied in the heavens represented'". 
                        Charles takes the point: it is "perfectly arbitrary, that one collection is called the <hi rend="italic">great bear</hi>, 
                        another <hi rend="italic">the dragon</hi>; a third <hi rend="italic">Hercules</hi>, and so on" 
                        (conversation 2, "Of the Fixed Stars", in Joyce, Scientific Dialogues, 2:13-14). 
                        The arbitrariness of naming extends beyond the ancient constellations to modern systems: 
                        "'If you look on the [celestial] globe'", the Tutor continues, "'you will observe, that . . . [lesser stars] are distinguished 
                        by the different letters of the Greek alphabet'", which are also assigned arbitrarily 
                        (conversation 3, "Of the Fixed Stars, and Ecliptic", Scientific Dialogues, 2:23).</p>
