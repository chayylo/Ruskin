                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> seems to set up the association in the prose section of <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL2">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title>,

                        in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, which they misdate as <date when="1827">1827</date>

                        but the editors&#x02BC; grounds for associating this draft with the draft of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title> also contained therein can perhaps 
                        be neither confirmed nor denied, since a piece of that draft manuscript of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;Constellations&#x201D;</title> is now very likely missing

                    <p>As internal evidence of dating, if <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> based portions of the poem on actual observation of the sky,

                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</ref>). However, to identify planetary movements accurately, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would need to have acquired sharper observational skills than simply finding <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name> circling the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#POLARIS">pole star</name>.

                        by a photograph of a manuscript, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title>, taken for the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> but unused. 
                        Entitled <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;THE CONSTELLATIONS NORTHERN / SOME OF THE ZODIAC / AND SOME OF THE SOUTHERN&#x201D;</title>, 
                        the original manuscript in the photograph is otherwise unknown, as are the occasion and date of its original purpose. 
                        The most valuable information revealed about the original is that it presented a fair&#x2010;copy text that predated 
                        the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version. The <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title> text runs the full length of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version, 
                        but several lines, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> crossed out and replaced by revisions scrawled in the margins, are incorporated in their revised form into the text of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version.</p>
                    
                    <p>Moreover, the photograph <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title> preserves a rare instance a manuscript that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> evidently intended as a presentation copy 
                        but that he spoiled for that purpose with revisions&#x2014;though whether he made the revisions before the original fair copy served its purpose, 
                        or after he had made some formal use of the manuscript, cannot be determined. The original manuscript consisted of a single folded sheet, 
                        with text fair&#x2014;copied on two sides of a single leaf (pp. 1&#x2013;2), leaving the other leaf (pp. 3&#x2013;4) blank originally. 
                        The fair&#x2014;copy text is print&#x2014;lettered in a small hand, using pen and ink, thus dating the manuscript as no earlier than <date when="1827-04">April 1827</date>, when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first began adopted that medium
                        (see <!-- LINK--><ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="hand_note.php">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</ref>). Then, at some point after making this fair copy, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> revised lines of the poem, using a cursive hand that is 
                        larger, sprawling, and freer than the original fair&#x2014;copy lettering. He made his initial revisions in pencil and then in several cases overwrote the penciled cursive revisions 
                        using pen and ink in a cursive hand.</p>
                    
                    <p>On the recto of the first leaf of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title> (p. 1 of the original fair&#x2014;copy text), <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote his revisions in the margin of the fair copy; 
                        and on the verso of that leaf (p. 2), he entered his corrections in the margin of the fair copy but extending across the fold 
                        into the facing page (originally blank). Here, too, he revised using pencil and then in some cases overwrote the revisions in ink. 
                        On the verso of the latter leaf (p. 4), he drafted revised lines in cursive using a pen. Pencil cursive text does appear beneath these pen&#x2014;and&#x2014;ink revised lines, 
                        but this handwriting belongs to a different text, unrelated to the poem.</p>
                    
                    <p>Presumably, though not certainly, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> made these revisions shortly before fair&#x2014;copying the revised text in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, 
                        perhaps in <date notBefore="1827-09" notAfter="1828-04">late 1827&#x2014;early 1828</date>. 
                        <!--(thus, incidentally, representing one of the earliest datable examples of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s longhand script).--> 
                        In fact, the original fair copy in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title>, and not just its revisions, may have only shortly predated the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version&#x2014;or 
                        at least the second page of the fair copy may have been significantly closer in time to the revisions. 
                        Starting at line 53 of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title>, the fair&#x2010;copy hand suddenly appears larger, and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> abandons the line numbering in the margin&#x2014;suggestions perhaps that, 
                        at this point, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may already have decided to sacrifice this fair copy to revision (see also textual note for line 54).<!--
                        On the last page of the folded sheet (i.e., p. 4) in the photograph, revised lines of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> 
                        appear to be written over top of a lighter script of lines that I am unable to connect definitely with any extant fair&#x2010;copy juvenilia: 
                        &#x201C;[to(?)] heaven but / not [to(?)] hell [for when (?)] / they went to / place [I(?)] say [that then (?)] / they took quite / a different way / and . . .&#x201D; 
                        (the writing continues for four more, illegible lines). The scrawled draft suggests notes for a sermon, although it might represent attempted revision of 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> since some lines were given a more pious cast in the final version 
                        (see, e.g., the textual notes for the lines &#x201C;The scales in which twas vainly said / The crime and virtues of men were weighed,&#x201D; and for the closing meditation on the superiority of virtue to knowledge). 
                        No surviving fair&#x2010;copy lines, however, even remotely match the faint draft.--> By comparison, the first page of the original fair copy shares characteristics 
                        with the earlier (<date when="1827">1827</date>) books 1&#x2013;2 of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title> as compared the later (<date when="1828">1828</date>) books 3&#x2013;4&#x2014;the use of punctuation that is both more frequent and more eccentric, 
                        sprinkled with colons that seem more decorative than functional, and commas that float above the baseline.

                <p>The <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA</ref> version appears to be the
                    earliest, a partial pencil draft, which starts with line 27 of the poem. (For
                    possible records of a now missing sheet of this draft, containing the opening 26
                    lines, see <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA: </ref>Contents, <hi
                        rend="italic">b</hi>.) This draft provided the basis for a fair copy in <ref
                        type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref>, which follows <ref type="mss"
                        target="xxx.html">MS IA</ref> closely, but which notably omits, at line 64,
                        <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA</ref>&#x02019;s &#x0201C;I
                    end end.&#x0201D; Since even <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA</ref>
                    continues its draft beyond this declaration, Ruskin clearly changed his mind in
                    mid&#45;draft about concluding the poem, and therefore he omitted this line
                    when fair&#45;copying for <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF
                    T70</ref>.</p>
                <p>The <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref> version in turn formed the
                    basis for the <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS III</ref> version. <ref
                        type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref> itself is a photograph, taken for
                    the <ref type="note" target="libraryedition.html">Library Edition</ref> but
                    unused, of a manuscript whose whereabouts is now unknown (see also <ref
                        type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA: </ref>Contents, <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi>). There appear to be at least three stages of composition reflected in
                    the manuscript.</p>
                <p>First, the photograph shows a neatly printed, ink fair copy, which runs the full
                    length of the poem, adhering to the text of <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS
                        IA</ref> at least from line 27, the first line currently extant. This fair
                    copy, moreover, improves the draft in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS
                        IA</ref> by capitalizing first letters of each line (and capitalizing the
                    entire first word of line 1); by punctiliously punctuating the end of each line,
                    through line 19 (after which end&#45;line punctuation is dropped); and by
                    inserting marginal line numbering at the left of the text.</p>
                <p>Next, the fair copy was used for revision, which appears to be represented in two
                    stages, first apparently in pencil and second in ink. Because the photograph can
                    show only relative darkness and texture of these insertions, the two stages
                    cannot always be definitively distinguished. It is unquestionable, however, that
                    the photograph shows a palimpsest since, in places, a dark ink hand overwrites a
                    much lighter hand, and under magnification the lighter hand shows the variable
                    texture of pencil stroke, and the darker hand the evenness of ink.</p>
                <p>Apparently in the first stage of this revision, someone using the lighter hand
                    marked the ends of lines with a short diagonal line (/), sometimes with a double
                    diagonal (//), but marked other lines with a cross (X), and the latter show
                    cancellations and insertions&#x02014;in the form of strikethrough and caret,
                    within the line; in the form of longhand insertion, in the margin. (Minor
                    variations occur in this pattern.) Presumably, the lines with Xs were flagged
                    for revision, but by whom, and whether by the same person who simultaneously or
                    subsequently wrote the insertion, one can only guess. On the whole, the marginal
                    insertions appear to be in pencil, the same color and texture as the diagonals
                    and Xs. The second stage of revision, insofar as it can be distinguished from
                    the first, appears to be represented by the ink overwriting. But the two stages
                    may be only apparent, and the actual sequence more complex.</p>
                <p>The longhand in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref> is somewhat
                    awkward, in keeping with the fact documented in family letters that Ruskin had
                    only recently started practicing longhand as well as the use of ink (see <ref
                        type="note" target="ruskinshand.html">Ruskin&#x02019;s Hand</ref>). It
                    is possible, however, that more than one hand is represented in the
                    revisions.</p>
                <p>There appear to be several possible reasons why the fair copy shown in <ref
                        type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref> was sacrificed to revision. Ruskin
                    may have felt that the fair&#45;copy was spoiled by the error in line 54,
                    which he ended with <hi rend="italic">appear,</hi> thus repeating the rhyme word
                    at the end of the previous line, in place of <hi rend="italic">bear,</hi> which
                    ends line 54 in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA</ref>, and to which he
                    returned in <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS III</ref>. Moreover, about the
                    same place, starting with with line 53 in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF
                        T70</ref>, the printing becomes noticeably larger, as if he was suddenly in
                    a hurry. Perhaps most importantly, two significant confusions arise in the sense
                    of the text at about this point.</p>
                <p>First, the pair of couplets starting at line 57 about the Scales and the Milky
                    Way, which made little sense in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA</ref>,
                    made even less sense in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref>; and
                    hence, lines 57&#x02013;60 of <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref>
                    are heavily scored through (and after line 60, Ruskin also stopped marginally
                    numbering the lines). First, it appears, Ruskin revised the first of these
                    couplets, concerning the scales, to arriving at the <ref type="mss"
                        target="3.html">MS III</ref> version (&#x0201C;The scales in which twas
                    vainly said / The crimes and virtues of men were weighed&#x0201D; [lines
                    57&#x02013;58]). Draft for these lines appear in ink draft at the bottom of
                    this sheet, overwriting an earlier, canceled pencil version (that earlier
                    version apparently still related the Scales to the Milky Way, but the lines are
                    largely illegible in the photograph).</p>
                <p>Then, in place of lines 59&#x02013;60 of <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF
                        T70</ref>, concerning the Milky Way, Ruskin composed five new lines and
                    inserted them as lines 65&#x02013;69 of <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS
                        III</ref>. The draft, which is worked out on both sides of the sheet
                    (including what would have been the blank p. 4 of the <ref type="mss"
                        target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref> folded fair copy), exhibits some tension
                    between an Evangelical assessment of pagan myths and the classical lines that
                    won out in <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS III</ref>. On p. 4, the
                    underwriting in pencil reads, &#x0201C;[to(?)] heaven but / not [to(?)] hell
                    [for when (?)] / they went to / place [I(?)] say [that then (?)] / they took
                    quite / a different way / and this is all that Ive to say about the beauty [(?)]
                    milky way.&#x0201D; Overwriting this are lines approximating, but not
                    identical to the <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS III</ref> version:
                    &#x0201C;which all their best and bravest trod / of heroes that their
                    countrys good / espoused and neer in angry mood / unto great jupiters blest
                    abode.&#x02019; The final version, in <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS
                        III</ref>, takes a middle way between the Christian piety of the pencil
                    draft and the classical patriotism of the ink draft: &#x0201C;But oh that
                    wonder of them all / Which milky way europeans call / And which the ancients
                    thought the road / Which all their best and bravest trod / Unto great Jupiters
                    blest abode.&#x0201D; (The first three lines of this version are worked out
                    in ink draft on p. 3 [inside spread, recto] of <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html"
                        >RF T70</ref>, &#x0201C;but oh that wonder of them all / which milky way
                    europeans call / and which the ancients thought the road.&#x0201D;)</p>
                <p>Another confusion toward the end of the <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF
                        T70</ref> fair copy (line 64, or line 62 in <ref type="mss" target="3.html"
                        >MS III</ref>), which may have contributed to Ruskin&#x02019;s giving up
                    this fair copy to revision, arose evidently from a muddle over the order of the
                    constellations, which failed to conform with the linear order of his <ref
                        type="note" target="catalog.html">catalog poem</ref>. Line 64 in the earlier
                    version, &#x0201C;I wish I had not observed the lyre,&#x0201D; harkened
                    back to line 17, &#x0201C;After that doth come the lyre.&#x0201D; At
                    both these points in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref>, a revision
                    about the &#x0201C;frightened hare&#x0201D; is entered in the margin,
                    which ultimately replaced line 17.</p>
                <p>The hand for these changes indicate a growing hurry and restlessness. As
                    suggested in Date, the evidence may point to hurried preparations for New
                    Year&#x02019;s.</p> -->

                            the poem, along with <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName>&#x02BC;s drawing, effectively forms <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;introduction to astronomy&#x201D;; and in the context of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s reading about astronomy, 
                        the poem&#x02BC;s seemingly mechanical exercise of listing the star clusters carries out the method, recommended by <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName>, of &#x201C;remembering these stars

Just so, in <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></title>, the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TUTORJJ">Tutor</persName> instructs

                        <p>In his poem, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> adopts the tactic of <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s tutors by starting from a prominent point of reference&#x2014;not, in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s case, a constellation, but 
                            a planet, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name>, the so&#x2010;called Morning Star and Evening Star, a wandering rather than a fixed star. 
                            He carries on to list the formations more or less in sequence, as do <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>&#x02BC;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYTD">Harry</persName> in drawing constellations on their globe. 
                            As a more sophisticated progression, <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TUTORJJ">Tutor</persName> leads his pupils 
                            from the diagram of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name> to a celestial globe, 
                            which he uses to orient the constellations to the ecliptic and equator; and then he directs the boys to an <hi rend="italic">ephemeris</hi>, a catalogue of star positions 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></title>, vol. 2, &#x201C;Of Astronomy&#x201D;, conversations 2&#x2013;4</ref>, 2:12&#x2013;47). 
                            Modern ephemerides were based on exacting observations and mathematical computations, which were the pride of scientifically advanced nations that produced these star catalogues; 
                            however, their forbidding tables made the ephemerides a &#x201C;primary culprit&#x201D; in driving away public interest in astronomy, 
                            displacing the appeal to popular imagination that the stars had presented in the annual almanacs with a professionalization of the science that seemed inaccessible to omateur &#x201C;sky&#x2010;loving men&#x201d;, in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s phrase

                            For many of the names and attributes, he used a source that remains to be identified. In the editorial glosses to the poem, 
                            some connections are made with books known to have been owned by the family; for the present, the mythology associated with the constellations is glossed

                            as do <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s adaptations of <persName corresp="#ME">Maria Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s lessons in his <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title> dialogues; and his verse novel, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>, 
                            crosses history with the supernatural. To what extent does <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> involve actual observation of the sky?
                        </p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> possibly derived some of his descriptions of constellations from actual observation of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name>, 
                        just as <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName> initially situates his fictional characters observing the evening sky at the end of a lingering walk. A planet is not an obvious starting point for charting the constellations, 
                        but the Evening Star and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> present easy&#x2010;to&#x2010;find referents for ordinary observers.</p>
                        <p>According to a digital&#x2010;age ephemeris, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> would have been visible from <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> as an evening star, 
                        setting in the west and appearing close to <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>&#x02BC;s belt, in <date notBefore="1828-03" notAfter="1828-05">March&#x2010;May 1828</date>. <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARS">Mars</name> would not have been visible high in the sky precisely at that time, 
                            but would have risen from the east somewhat later, after <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> had set. (An observer might also have confused Mars<name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARS">Mars</name> with the bright star, 
                            <name type="astronomical" corresp="#SIRIUS">Sirius or &#x201C;Dog Star&#x201d;</name>, in the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CANISMAJOR">Canis Major</name> directly below <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>.) 
                            This particular configuration of planets and constellations would not have appeared at any other time in <date when="1828">1828</date>, and would not have been visible at all in <date when="1827">1827</date>. 
                            Since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> describes this configuration at the beginning of the poem, which he most likely composd in <date when="1827">1827</date>, 
                            his description probably is not based on actual sky&#x2010;gazing&#x2014;or at least not accurate observation.</p>
                        <p>Always visible, however, and easier to pick out of the night sky, are 
                            <!--During those three months in <date when="1828">1828</date>&#x2014;the time when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>

                            If the sequence of constellations listed in the poem reflects an actual evening observation, an observer could have looked up from <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> setting in the west, to <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major (the Great Bear)</name> overhead; 
                            following the &#x201C;pointers&#x201d; in <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name>, the observer would have found 
                            the tail of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#DRACO">Draco (the Dragon)</name> winding to the northeast; and then turning eastward, he would have encountered

                        <p>Hereafter, the sequence in the poem would have shifted an actual observer&#x02BC;s gaze erratically around the dome of the sky. For <name type="astonomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus (the Swan)</name>, 
                            he would have turned back to the northeast, looking beyond <name type="astronomical" corresp="#DRACO">Draco</name> toward the horizon; and then to find <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSHEART">Cor Caroli (Charles&#x02BC;s Heart)</name>, 
                            which is a star in <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CANESVENATICI">Canes Venatici (Hunting Dogs)</name>, 
                            he would have turned in the opposite direction, back to the region of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CORONABOREALIS">Corona Borealis</name> and 
                            <name type="astronomical" corresp="#COMABERENICES">Coma Berenices</name>

                        <p>Beyond this point, the logic of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s repeated &#x201C;next comes&#x201D;, if the list represents any plan at all, maps a generally counter&#x2010;clockwise rotation, 
                            although the sequentially named constellations are not adjacent. The now obsolete constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#TELESCOPIUM"><persName corresp="#WHERSCHEL">Herschell</persName>&#x02BC;s Telescope</name>, 
                            which was located within <name type="astronomical" corresp="#AURIGA">Auriga (the Charioteer)</name>, was adjacent neither to the previously named <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSHEART">Cor Caroli (Charles&#x02BC;s Heart)</name>, nor to the subsequently named 
                            <name type="astronomical" corresp="#EQUULEUS">Equuleus (Little Horse)</name>, which lies between <name type="astronomical" corresp="#PEGASUSCONSTELLATION">Pegasus</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#DELPHINUS">Delphinus</name>. Continuing counter&#x2010;clockwise brings the viewer to 
                            <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VULPECULA">Vulpecula</name>; however, to get from <name type="astronomical">Vulpecula</name> to <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEPUS">Lepus</name>&#x2014;from goose to hare&#x2014;requires a full semicircle turn, either counter&#x2010;clockwise or clockwise (and a dip below the celestial equator, as well), 
                            and when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> next shoots up to the pole star in <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMINOR">Ursa Minor</name>, all rationale for the arrangement seems lost. Perhaps <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> merely wanted to rhyme <hi rend="italic">hare</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bear</hi>, 
                            although, as suggested in the contextual glosses, he may have also have avoided violence by separating the Goose from the Fox in the combined constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VULPECULAETANSER">Vulpecula et Anser</name>.
                        have darted in different directions to find ; 
                         and so on 
                         Of course, if based on any actual observation at all, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem may reflect a mix of experience and information gleaned from a book or globe.</p>
                    <p>A distinct difference between <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem and <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s dialogue is that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> is interested in the poetic images evoked by the mythic names, whereas 
                        <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TUTORJJ">Tutor</persName> and his scholars, while ready to quote illustrative poetry, are dismissive of what they regard as largely humbug: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">James</hi>. 
                        &#x2018;Why are the signs of the Zodiac called by the several names of <name type="astrological" corresp="#ARIES">Aries</name>, <name type="astrological" corresp="#TAURUS">Taurus</name>, <name type="astrological" corresp="#LEO">Leo</name>, &#x0026;c. 
                        I see no likeness in the heavens to Rams, or Bulls, or Lions, which are the English words for those Latin ones&#x2019;.

                        In fact, a lesson that <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TUTORJJ">Tutor</persName> dwells on is the arbitrariness underlying the naming systems of astronomy. 
                        The imagined patterns in the sky, whereby the Greek ordered and named the constellations, were arbitrary constructions, the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TUTORJJ">Tutor</persName> emphasizes: 
                        &#x201C;&#x2018;The ancients, that they might the better distinguish and describe the stars, with regard to their situation in the heavens, 
                        divided them into constellations, that is, systems of stars, each system consisting of such stars as were near to each other, 
                        giving them the names of such men or things, as they fancied the space which they occupied in the heavens represented&#x2019;&#x201D;. 
                        <persName type="fictional" corresp="#CHARLESJJ">Charles</persName> takes the point: it is &#x201C;perfectly arbitrary, that one collection is called the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMAJOR"><hi rend="italic">great bear</hi></name>, 
                        another <name type="astronomical" corresp="#DRACO"><hi rend="italic">the dragon</hi></name>; a third <name type="astronomical" corresp="#HERCULESCONSTELLATION"><hi rend="italic">Hercules</hi></name>, and so on&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES">conversation 2, <title type="lesson" corresp="#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUESFIXEDSTARS">&#x201C;Of the Fixed Stars&#x201D;</title>, in <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></title></ref>, 2:13&#x2013;14). 
                        The arbitrariness of naming extends beyond the ancient constellations to modern systems: 
                        &#x201C;&#x2018;If you look on the [celestial] globe&#x2019;&#x201D;, the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TUTORJJ">Tutor</persName> continues, &#x201C;&#x2018;you will observe, that . . . [lesser stars] are distinguished 
                        by the different letters of the Greek alphabet&#x2019;&#x201D;, which are also assigned arbitrarily
