                    <p>Undated fair copy in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, 
                        where title written <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;THE CONSTELLATIONS / NORTHERN, SOME OF THE ZODIAC AND / SOME OF THE SOUTHERN.&#x201D;</title>. 
                        Its placement after the second volume of <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL2">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title> 
                        and before <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHESUN">&#x201C;The Sun&#x201D;</title> suggests <date when="1828-01-01">New Year&#x02BC;s 1828</date>. 
                        Indeed, in the prose section of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> preceding the poem, 
                        <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> gives <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName> 
                        a drawing of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name> &#x201C;as an introduction to astronomy&#x201D;. 
                        Thus, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s editors are strictly correct in listing the poem under <date when="1827">1827</date>&#x2014;that is, 
                        composition in late <date when="1827">1827</date> for a <date when="1828-01-01">New Year&#x02BC;s 1828</date> presentation. 
                        However, the editors seem to intend earlier <date when="1827">1827</date>, associating the poem with the rough draft of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title> 
                        in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, which they misdate as <date when="1827">1827</date>. 
                        If they based their dating on harder evidence contained in the rough draft of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;Constellations&#x201D;</title> 
                        in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 2:535), 
                        their reasoning cannot be confirmed or denied, since a piece of that rough draft manuscript is now very likely missing.
                        The evidence in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> does hold open a possibility for an earlier date. 
                        As noted in nos. 1 and 4, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> seems habitually to have included his previous year&#x02BC;s presentation poems 
                        along with the most recent New Year&#x02BC;s gift in his <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title> books 
                        (e.g., in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> includes another older New Year&#x02BC;s poem, no. 4, in this group). 
                        Thus, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> could have existed as a New Year&#x02BC;s gift for <date when="1827">1827</date>, 
                        although no positive evidence supports the possibility.</p>

                    <p>A separate presentation copy of the poem is represented at the <orgName corresp="#RUSKINLIBRARYLANCASTER">Ruskin Library</orgName> 
                        by a photograph of a manuscript, taken for the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> but unused 
                        (RF T70; for its physical description, see part 2, MS IA, &#x201C;Contents,&#x201D; b). 
                        The location of the original manuscript is unknown, as are the occasion and date of its presentation, 
                        and its physical characteristics, other than its consisting of a single folded sheet. 
                        Entitled <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;THE CONSTELLATIONS NORTHERN / SOME OF THE ZODIAC / AND SOME OF THE SOUTHERN&#x201D;</title>, 
                        the photograph shows a fair&#x2010;copy version predating the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> fair copy. 
                        It runs the full length of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version, 
                        but several lines are crossed out and revisions scrawled in the margins&#x2014;revisions that all appear in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version, 
                        excepting a word or two that were altered again for that final version. The revisions are written in an awkward longhand, 
                        unlike the tiny print lettering of the fair copy.
                        Presumably, the RF T70 revisions were made shortly before the <date notBefore="1827-09" notAfter="1828-04">late 1827&#x2014;early 1828</date> fair copy 
                        in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> (thus, incidentally, representing one of the earliest datable examples of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s longhand script). 
                        In fact, the RF T70 fair copy itself, and not just its revisions, may have only shortly predated the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version. 
                        At line 53 of RF T70, the fair&#x2010;copy hand suddenly becomes larger and more careless, suggesting that, at this point, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> decided to sacrifice this fair copy to revision (see also textual note for line 54).
                        On the last page of the folded sheet (i.e., p. 4) in the photograph, revised lines of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> 
                        appear to be written over top of a lighter script of lines that I am unable to connect definitely with any extant fair&#x2010;copy juvenilia: 
                        &#x201C;[to(?)] heaven but / not [to(?)] hell [for when (?)] / they went to / place [I(?)] say [that then (?)] / they took quite / a different way / and . . .&#x201D; 
                        (the writing continues for four more, illegible lines). The scrawled draft suggests notes for a sermon, although it might represent attempted revision of 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> since some lines were given a more pious cast in the final version 
                        (see, e.g., the textual notes for the lines &#x201C;The scales in which twas vainly said / The crime and virtues of men were weighed,&#x201D; and for the closing meditation on the superiority of virtue to knowledge). 
                        No surviving fair&#x2010;copy lines, however, even remotely match the faint draft.</p>

                    <p>In volume 2, "Of Astronomy", of Jeremiah Joyce's Scientific Dialogues, 
                        the Tutor defines the constellations as an ancient but arbitrary construction: 
                        "'The ancients, that they might the better distinguish and describe the stars, with regard to their situation in the heavens, 
                        divided them into constellations, that is, systems of stars, each system consisting of such stars as were near to each other, 
                        giving them the names of such men or things, as they fancied the space which they occupied in the heavens represented'". 
                        Charles takes the point that the formation of the constellations is "perfectly arbitrary, 
                        that one collection is called the <hi rend="italic">great bear</hi>, another <hi rend="italic">the dragon</hi>; 
                        a third <hi rend="italic">Hercules</hi>, and so on" (conversation 2, "Of the Fixed Stars", in Joyce, Scientific Dialogues, 2:13-14).
