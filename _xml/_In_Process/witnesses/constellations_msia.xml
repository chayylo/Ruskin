                        A glorious sight for all sky loving men
                        And then red mars appeareth high

                        Then doth come the cunning fox
                        Then appears the blessed cross
                        Then we see great charles’s oak
                        Next I’ll call it juno’s cup
                        Hercules appeareth high
                        Next cerberus in the sky

                        Next to it the butting ram
                        Sobieski’s shield up there
                        After it the charioteer

                        Perseus pegasus then
                        After it the chamelion
                        Andromeda is seen on high
                        Then the virgin in the sky
                        Ten starred triangle doth appear
                        The horn the unicorn doth bear
                        Shining in golden light he’s drest
                        With a horn instead of a towering crest
                        The scales in which twas vainly said
                        The crimes and virtues of men were weighed
                        The archer with his flying dart
                        I should not think it would pierce the heart
                        The crab and the twins with their clothes of fire
                        After them doth come the lyre3
                        The little triangle appears on high
                        And the goat that is formed in the arched sky
                        But oh that wonder of them all
                        Which milky way europeans call
                        And which the ancients thought the road
                        Which all their best and bravest trod
                        Unto great Jupiters blest abode
                        Bright these stars are beauteous gold
                        But let history unfold
                        Her page of learning let us see
                        Whether that is not more bright than thee
                        Een thou O beauteous mercury
                        Much better than the brightest star
                        Virtue I will say you are
                        Better than knowledge yes indeed
                        Virtue you should have the lead
