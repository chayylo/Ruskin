                        A Legend of Italy.
                        
                        The Lord of <placeName corresp="#CASTLEALTO"> Castel Alto</placeName>is old and gray-headed;
                        four-score years have flitted silently over him, and the
                        dream of his life is nigh to its awaking, and his ear is
                        dull, and his eye is dim, and his heart is weary.
                        
                        The old man reclines on a couch in the hall of his
                        ancestors, beside an open casement, and the balmy air
                        that floats over the deep blue waters of the broad sea,
                        passes softly through his thin hair, and his weary eye
                        rests on the brightness of a lovely landscape; for the
                        olive, and the orange, and the myrtle, are green by the
                        shore of the still waters; and the city lies whitely
                        beneath the glance of the sun, as he rides through the
                        cloudless azure of the heaven; while the purple
                        mountains clasp the ocean in their arms, and fade
                        away into the horizon in long lines of misty blue.
                        Alas! the spring time of nature is a mockery to the
                        winter of age, and <persName corresp="#AMAL">Amalfiero</persName>turns away in sadness.
                        His vassals are waiting around him to do him pleasure;
                        the minstrel is there with his harp, the maiden with

                        her song; but no music is so sweet to the old man&#x02BC;s
                        ear as the voice of his daughter <persName corresp="#GIULIETTA">Giulietta</persName>.
                        <persName corresp="#GIULIETTA">Giulietta</persName>, when a babe, was a thing of smiles and
                        loveliness, like a happy thought dancing over the
                        mind. <persName corresp="#GIULIETTA">Giulietta</persName>, when a child, was like the orange
                        blossom in the groves of <placeName corresp="#FRIULI">Friuli</placeName>, and gladness floated
                        around her like the fragrance of the flower. <persName corresp="#GIULIETTA">Giulietta</persName>,
                        in her youth, was the fairest maiden of Italy, - she
                        glanced among the myrtle bowers like the winged
                        zephyr: the evening star, when it rises gleaming
                        out of the sea into the darkness of the glorious night
                        of Italy, is not so bright as the beam that flashed from
                        her large ege through the night of her lovely eye-
                        lashes. <persName corresp="#GIULIETTA">Giulietta</persName>&#x02BC;s mind was love - all love to each
                        and every thing.
                        Like music to the sadness of the soul, was <persName corresp="#GIULIETTA">Giulietta</persName>
                        to the old age of her father. As she passed before
                        him, a light came into the coldness of his eye; and his
                        ear, when it was dead to other sound, awoke to the
                        murmur of her gentle voice. As an angel watches
                        over the last days of a saint upon the earth, when the
                        tumult of the battle of his life is over, and sheds
                        peace around his hours, and bids his days pass sweetly
                        and holily, so <persName corresp="GIULIETTA">Giulietta</persName> watched over <persName corresp="AMAL">Amalfiero</persName> like an
                        influence of good, and was the sun of his thoughts,
                        and the light of his rejoicing.
                        <persName corresp="GIULIETTA">Giulietta</persName> had a brother.<persName corresp="GARCIO">Garcio d&#x02BC;Amalfiero</persName> was a
                        man of a dark countenance, and the shadows of his
                        evil passions passed over it, like clouds over the
                        luridness of the stormy heaven, and his look withered
                        
                        those upon whom it fell, and his wrath, once excited,
                        raged like a pestilence, and would not be appeased.
                        He was loved by few, and had many enemies, none of
                        whom he hated as he did the bandit <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName>, for him
                        only he feared.
                        <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName> &#x02BC;s better nature had been borne down by the
                        violence of his passions, and he became what he ab-
                        horred, and widely was the fear of his name spread;
                        for he passed over the land like a meteor, and left de-
                        solation behind him in the palaces of the great and
                        the powerful, but not in the hamlets of the poor.
                        Returning from a successful attack on the castle of
                        a neighbouring baron, <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName> had been once tracked to
                        the fastnesses of the Apennines by <persName corresp="GARCIO">Garcio</persName>, with
                        a chosen troop of his followers. The bandit gave him
                        battle, and was, as usual, victorious; the followers of
                        <persName corresp="#GARCIO">Garcio</persName> cowered back from his thunderbolt charge, and
                        <persName corresp="#GARCIO">Garcio</persName> himself was struck from his horse by the sword
                        of <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName>. It had been said of the bandit, that he had
                        never deserted a friend, nor spared an enemy; but, as
                        his sabre waved over the head of his prostrate foe,
                        the beaver of <persName corresp="#GARCIO">Garcio</persName>&#x02BC;s helmet fell open: <persName corresp="LEONI">Leoni</persName>&#x02BC;s arm was
                        arrested as if by the hand of an invisible being, a
                        smile of scorn passed over his lip, and then a mildness
                        came into his eye; he turned calmly away; and, to
                        the astonishment of his followers, sounded a retreat in
                        the very flush of victory, while <persName corresp="#GARCIO">Garcio</persName> and his dis-
                        heartened and vanquished band were suffered to retire
                        unmolested. From that time the hatred of <persName corresp="#GARCIO">Garcio</persName> to
                        <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName> was inextinguishable. The shame of defeat,
                        
                        and the thirst of revenge gnawed into his heart like
                        vultures, for he had rather have been laid dead by the
                        sword of <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName>, than have owed his life to the clemency
                        of his conqueror.
                       
                        * * * * *
                        
                        Giulietta sat in her chamber in the eastern tower of
                        Castel Alto . The evening star rose out of the sea ,
                        and climbed slowly up into the sky , and Giulietta's
                        dark eye rested sadly upon it . She was waiting for a
                        voice that rose , every evening , from the myrtle grove
                        below the castle , as that star disappeared behind the
                        peak of a distant mountain . Giulietta hardly knew how
                        very sweet the voice was to her listening ear , for it
                        was the voice of one who loved her with a more than
                        common love . They had first met when Giulietta was
                        young , very young , and Francesco just verging into
                        manhood - from that hour she was the light of his
                        path, and the joy of his heart . Her father knew
                        not of his child's love for Francesco , who pleaded
                        to Giulietta some ancient feud of their families , as an
                        excuse for maintaining his secresy .
                        When the star touched the misty summit of the
                        mountain, and Giulietta drew near to the window , a
                        blush passed over her fair cheek as a minstrel's song
                        rose upon the breeze .
                        
                        Full broad and bright is the silver light
                        Of moon and stars , on flood and fell ;
                        But in my breast is starless night ,
                        For I am come to say farewell .
                        
                        How glad , how swift was wont to be ,
                        The step that bore me back to thee ;
                        Now coldly comes upon my heart ,
                        The meeting that is but to part .
                        
                        “I do not ask a tear, but while
                        I linger where I must not stay,
                        0 , give me but a parting smile ,
                        To light me on my lonely way .
                        To shine , a brilliant beacon star ,
                        To my reverted glance , afar ,
                        Through midnight , which can have no morrow ,
                        O'er the deep , silent , surge of sorrow . ”
                        
                        Giulietta opened a secret door , and descended , and
                        Francesco saw her come forth in her beauty .
                        “ What meant thy song to - night , Francesco ? ” said
                        the maiden .
                        “ What can a farewell to thee mean , Giulietta , but
                        misery ? "
                        " Nay , this is madness , Francesco , ” replied the
                        maiden , “ wherefore must we part ? ”
                        “ Thou sayest well , Giulietta , we will not part , -fly
                        with me , -night is on the mountains , my band is near .
                        Ere the day dawn we shall be far hence , in safety , in
                        honour , and — if thou wilt , in power . ”
                        " Thy band ! ” repeated Giulietta , “ fly with thee !
                        With whom ? What meanest thou ? What art thou ,
                        Francesco ? ”
                        “ I know not , maiden ! ” said Francesco , “ I have
                        
                        not been what I seem to be , yet thou couldst make
                        me so . With thee , I am Francesco ; without thee , I
                        am a pestilence , a scourge , -in a word , without thee , I
                        am - Leoni .
                        And the name struck through to the maiden's heart
                        with a coldness as of death ; the cry she would have
                        uttered died upon her lips , and she fainted in the arms
                        of her lover .
                        A hectic flush passed over her cheek , and she woke
                        from the partial death with a deep gasp as of one in
                        pain , and her dark eye was filled with a vague horror .
                        “ Francesco , Francesco ! ” she said , “ thou toldest me
                        something , - it was terrible , tell it me again . Fran-
                        cesco ! -thou art not Francesco , " and she paused for a
                        moment . “ I know now , " she said ; “ I remember
                        well , very well , Francesco is dead , and thou — thou
                        art not , thou canst not , thou shalt not be Leoni , - the
                        bandit Leoni , - my brother's enemy . O , Francesco !
                        say thou mockest me ! "
                        “ I was once Leoni , ” he replied ; - “ thy brother's
                        enemy never , or Garcio had not now lived . Could I
                        be the enemy of your brother , Giulietta ? ”
                        And Giulietta felt that it was Francesco , and not
                        Leoni who spoke , and she paused in deep agony .
                        
                        * * * * *
                        
                        Great was the tumult at <placeName corresp="CASTLEALTO">Castel Alto</placeName>. An old fisher-
                        man of <persName corresp="POZZ">Pozzuolo</persName> had informed <persName corresp="GARCIO"></persName>Garcio that he had
                        seen two figures passing down westward on the sea-
                        shore, at the foot of the castle. One was a maiden of
                        exceeding beauty, the countenance of the other, he
                        
                        said, was one which he knew well, and which, once
                        seen, was not easily forgotten, - that of the bandit
                        <persName corresp="LEONI">Leoni</persName>. Then Garcio was wild with rage, and he
                        called his followers together, and the clash of arms was
                        loud in the hall, and then, from the gate of Castel
                        Alto, issued a troop of warriors, and their mail shone
                        cold in the starlight, and Garcio spurred on his bloody
                        war - horse in the van. His countenance was pale with
                        wrath, and he dashed madly forward along the wind-
                        ing shore .
                        But one of the maidens of Giulietta, when she heard
                        the peasant's tale, went and sought for her in her
                        father's hall, and she was not there: and in her cham-
                        ber, and she was not there; and she descended by the
                        secret staircase, and she saw footsteps in the dew on
                        the grassy ground. Then she returned weeping, and
                        came to Amalfiero, and told him that Leoni the bandit
                        had carried away Giulietta. And the old man was
                        very feeble, and he bowed his head gently upon his
                        breast and died.
                        
                        * * * * *
                        
                        “Heardest thou nothing?”,<persName corresp="#GIULIETTA">Giulietta</persName> said to <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName>.
                        “Nothing, <persName corresp="#GIULIETTA">Giulietta</persName>,” he replied. &#x201C;Nay, now
                        that I listen, methinks I hear a sound, far away, like
                        the tramp of steeds along the sand.” And <persName corresp="#GIULIETTA">Giulietta</persName>
                        listened, and she was filled with great fear.
                        “Oh fly, <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName>!” she said, “It is <persName corresp="#GARCIO"> Garcio</persName>! Fly,
                        and leave me here!” But <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName> raised her in his
                        arms, and bare her softly forward.
                        And now the rocks were seen rising high from the

                        sea-shore, with the columns of a ruined temple upon
                        their summit, and <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName> knew that his band was near.
                        “On, on, <persName corresp="#GIULIETTA">Giulietta</persName>!” he exclaimed, “One effort
                        more, and we are safe.” And now the tramp of the
                        galloping horses came nearer and nearer, and the
                        voices of men were heard urging them on. Louder
                        and louder became the sound, and <persName corresp="#GIULIETTA">Giulietta</persName> made one
                        last struggle forward, and,having gained the rocks,
                        the lovers stood beneath the ruins.
                        “Anselmo! Anselmo!” cried <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName>; and he was
                        answered, by a shout from the rocks, and the banditti
                        leaped from their concealment; but ere they gained
                        the shore, the foremost horseman of the opposite troop
                        dashed into view. It was <persName corresp="#GARCIO">Garcio</persName>. A shout of triumph
                        burst from his lips when he saw <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName>. <persName corresp="#GIULIETTA">Giulietta</persName> saw
                        him level his carbine, and, with a shriek of agony, she
                        threw herself before <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName>, and fell dead into his arms .
                        The band of <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName> heard the shot, and were around
                        him in an instant: and lo! their leader was standing
                        inactive beside the body of a maiden. There was a
                        stillness in his eye, and on his features; but it was as
                        the stillness of the volcano before it bursts forth into
                        desolation. His troops stood round him in a fearful
                        silence, and there was a pause, until, like a whirlwind
                        over the quietness of deep waters, came the madness
                        upon the soul of <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName>. He looked up, and saw that
                        his band was beside him.
                        “Stand by me, this night,” he said, “And revenge
                        the loss of your leader.” Then he shouted his war-
                        cry, and the banditti swelled the sound with eager
                        
                        voices . The followers of Garcio replied , and Leoni
                        dashed at them like a thunderbolt . Then loudly into
                        the quietness of the heaven rose the roar of the battle ,
                        and the echoes rolled heavily over the sea .
                        Leoni burst his path through the mass of battle , and
                        his bloodshot eye was on the crest of Garcio ; and ,
                        whether it were foe or friend whom he met in his
                        frenzy , he dashed the combatants aside , and clove
                        his way to that one plume . With the implacable
                        wrath of an avenging spirit , Leoni sought his single foe .
                        The followers of Garcio shrunk from his glance , and , as
                        he broke through the front of their battle , some turned
                        and fled , and the rest hung back in disorder and dismay .
                        Then Garcio saw Leoni come upon him with the
                        swoop of an eagle , and his eye quailed before the des-
                        pair of his foe .
                        “ Wretch , ” cried Leoni , “ lovest thou life ? —O ,
                        would that I could make life to thee , what thou
                        hast made it to me , and thou shouldst live ! I spared
                        thee once , for her sake , —thou hast well rewarded me !
                        —thy sister strikes thee , Garcio ! ” And he smote him
                        dead .
                        And the voice of battle drifted away towards
                        Castel Alto , and the shouts of the victorious banditti
                        were heard echoing along the cliffs . But Leoni was
                        no longer at their head ; in their victory they were
                        without a leader , -- they remembered that he had com-
                        manded them to revenge his loss , and few , very few ,
                        of the followers of Garcio , escaped the slaughter of
                        that night . The banditti met , and sought for Leoni
                        
                        among the dead , and they found the body of Garcio ,
                        and the sword of their leader lying beside it ; but him
                        they found not . And they retired , silently , under cover
                        of the night , to their fastness among the mountains .
                        O calmly , brightly , beautifully rose the morning
                        out of the eastern sea , and widely spread the rosy
                        dawn over the deep ! Gloriously the radiance stole up
                        into the high heaven , where the white clouds waved
                        their light wings in the deepness of the infinite blue ,
                        and looked out eastward , rejoicing , as they met the
                        morning breeze that sprang upward from its repose , in
                        the grove of silver olives . And the sun lifted his
                        head majestically out of the sea , and the mists passed
                        away before his glance , from its surface , and the
                        waves rolled onward , singing , with sweet low voices ,
                        and a long golden path was thrown upon them , even
                        unto the shore .
                        O the radiance of that morning was unconscious of
                        the desolation of the night ! There was no sadness in
                        the dawn that shone on the ruins of Castel Alto . The
                        surges that , in the night , had dashed away the blood
                        from the shore , now broke clear and white on the un-
                        stained pebbles . A figure was leaning against a rock
                        on the strand . Few , very few could have recognised ,
                        in the haggard face , and withered form , the once
                        haughty and fiery Leoni .
                        The fishermen of Pozzuolo affirm , that , for years
                        after that terrible night , the same figure was seen
                        pacing the shore , with the unequal step , and wild
                        gestures of a maniac .
