                    While not the first publication to sponsor Ruskin's writing, Friendship's Offering was the first widely distributed venue 
                    for his poetry, beginning with "Saltzburg" and "Fragments from a Metrical Journal", which appeared in the annual volume for 1835 
                    (released in October or November 1834, for the holiday season). Thereafter, Friendshp's Offering remained a reliable showcase for Ruskin's verse, 
                    which appeared in nearly every volume: debutfeatured some of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s earliest published poetry.</p>

                        According to a bibliography of the annuals,

                    <p>In the wake of <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName>&#x02BC;s outstanding success, <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> was published 
                        by <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Lupton Relfe</persName>, a bookseller in <placeName type="building" corresp="#CORNHILL">Cornhill Street</placeName>. According to an <date when="1858">1858</date> reflection on the heyday of annuals, 
                        <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>&#x02BC;s product was &#x201C;unpromising&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ANNUALSOFFORMERDAYS"><title type="annual" corresp="#ANNUALSOFFORMERDAYS">&#x201C;The Annuals of Former Days&#x201D;</title></ref>, 496). 
                        In retrospect, <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> was struggling to escape the paraphernalia that attached it to the annual&#x02BC;s origins in the eighteenth&#x2010;century almanac and &#x201C;pocket book&#x201D; 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</ref>). 
                        This effort was acknowledged by the editor, <persName corresp="#TKH">T. K. Hervey</persName> (<date notBefore="1799" notAfter="1859">1799&#x2013;1859</date>), 
                        in his prefatory remarks for the <date when="1826">1826</date> volume: while &#x201C;difficulties&#x201D; had arisen from the publication having, &#x201C;very recently, come into the present Editor&#x02BC;s hands 
                        with a view to an entire change in its character and plan&#x201D; (<persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName> had in fact edited the title since <date when="1824">1824</date>), 
                        he only now succeeded in making &#x201C;alterations . . . consist[ing] in the removal of all those features which marked it as more peculiarly adapted for one season of the year than another&#x201d;, 
                        with the aim instead of &#x201C;combining, with the increased beauty of its embellishments, a high literary character&#x201d; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName>, ed., <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> [<date when="1826">1826</date>]</ref>, v, vi). 
                        According to <persName corresp="#KDH">Katherine D. Harris</persName>, the hodgepodge of calendar pages, informational charts, and sheet music did fall away in the <date when="1826">1826</date> volume, 
                        but <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> under the supervision of its founders remained derivative and imitative 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title></ref>, 124&#x2013;26). 
                        The annual became a distinctive contribution to the early Victorian type only when, in <date when="1827">1827</date>, the publication was taken over by the relatively young stationery and bookselling firm of 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="smith_elder_note.php"><orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder, &#x0026; Company</orgName></ref>,

                        and which had so far undertaken only modest publishing ventures.</p>

                        (released presumably in <date notBefore="1826-10" notAfter="1826-12">late 1826</date>), edited by <persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName> and <persName corresp="#BEPOTE">B. E. Pote</persName> 
                        (<title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#HARRISINDEXANNUALS">&#x201C;Editors and Publishers of British Literary Annuals, <date notBefore="1823" notAfter="1831">1823&#x2013;31</date>&#x201D;</title>, in

                        In <date when="1827">1827</date>, <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> released their first volume of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> &#x201C;for&#x201D; <date when="1828">1828</date>, under the editorship of <persName corresp="#CK">Charles Knight</persName> (<date notBefore="1791" notAfter="1873">1791&#x2013;1873</date>), 
                        the future publisher for the <orgName corresp="#SDUK">Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge</orgName>, who was then struggling to establish himself in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> publishing. 
                        <persName corresp="#CK">Knight</persName> was succeeded in the following year by <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" corresp="#TP"><persName corresp="#TP">Thomas Pringle</persName></ref>, 
                        recently returned from disappointed hopes of advancement in <placeName corresp="#SOUTHAFRICA">South Africa</placeName>, but gaining recognition as a poet and as an activist in the <orgName corresp="#ANTISLAVERYSOCIETY">Anti&#x2010;Slavery Society</orgName>. 
                        It was <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> who would later introduce <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to the fashionable literary world as the author, &#x201C;<persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JR">J.R.</persName>&#x201D; 
                        Under <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>&#x02BC;s custodianship, <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> 
                        (its subtitle expanded to <hi rend="italic">A Literary Album, and Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present</hi>)
                        improved strikingly in its material appeal. Sales rose, eventually peaking at ten thousand copies per year, assuring the fortunes of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> as a publisher. 
                        (By comparison, <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName>&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> in some years achieved twenty thousand.)

                    <p>The success of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>&#x02BC;s venture appears to have hinged on a striking physical presentation of binding and printing and on the appeal of the illustrations.
                        The first volume of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> under the new proprietorship received a complimentary notice in  
                        <title type="periodical" corresp="#MIRROROFLITERATURE"><hi rend="italic">The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction</hi></title>, 
                        the review focusing first on the &#x201C;exterior, which is somewhat novel in taste, . . . by substituting for the usual paper covering 
                        [i.e., like the printed paper boards then covering the <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title>], an elegantly embossed leather binding. 
                        This is altogether an improvement on the original plan, since the slight coverings of silk or paper is scarcely safe out of the drawing&#x2010;room or boudoir, 
                        and some of the contributions to the &#x2018;annuals&#x2019; entitle them to a higher stand&#x201D;
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SPIRITOFTHEANNUALS"><title type="periodical" corresp="#MIRROROFLITERATURE">&#x201C;Spirit of &#x2018;The Annuals&#x2019; for 1828&#x201D;</title></ref>, 418). 
                        By the &#x201C;original plan&#x201D;, the writer refers apparently to the binding used by <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>, 
                        which consisted of glazed paper boards, printed with a decorative and typographic cover, in imitation of the binding for the <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> 
                        (the latter already moving to silk; see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title></ref>, 133).
                        The new binding of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> featured an arabesque design that was blind embossed into the full surface of the dark leather cover, 
                        with a lyre design blocked in gilt in the center of the front cover. As <persName corresp="#EJ">Eleanore Jamieson</persName> remarks in 
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JAMIESONBINDINGSTYLES"><title type="essay"  corresp="#JAMIESONBINDINGSTYLES">&#x201C;The Binding Styles of the Gift Books and Annuals&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        the arabesque pattern was regarded as a revival style hearkening to the early book, 
                        and the style was associated with Continental models
                        (p. 11; and see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</ref>).</p>
                    
                    <p>The annuals dueled to be judged by their covers, the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> having set an initial standard with its printed and glazed paper boards, 
                        cloth spine, and slipcase, later replaced by a silk cover 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FORDACKERMANN"><persName corresp="#JFORD">Ford</persName>, <title type="biography" corresp="#FORDACKERMAN"><hi rend="italic">Ackermann</hi></title></ref>, 65).  
                        Innovation and extravagance&#x2014;or at least the appearance of extravagance&#x2014;in bindings and engraved or lithographed front matter became characteristic of annuals, 
                        which used this immediate source of appeal to compete in a crowded market 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FAXONLITERARYANNUALS">Faxon, <title type="bibliography" corresp="FAXONLITERARYANNUALS"><hi rend="italic">Literary Annuals</hi></title></ref>, xiv&#x2013;xvi). 
                        Mechanization brought these material appeals within reach of the ordinary consumer; and mass-produced fancy bindings in particular 
                        shifted traditional division of labor, since publishers took on this burden, which conventionally was borne by the consumer.

                        According to <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER"><persName corresp="#LHUXLEY">Huxley</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER"><hi rend="italic">House of Smith Elder</hi></title></ref>, 
                        <persName corresp="#AE">Elder</persName> was interested in art, and aspired to produce elegantly illustrated publications (p. 10). 
                        Illustration was key to the popularity of the annuals, as <persName corresp="#AE">Elder</persName> would have realized from the precedent set by <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName>&#x02BC;s success. 
                        The first issue of <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> had featured a series of emblematic treatments of the twelve months, rendered in copper etching, 
                        along with verses by <persName corresp="#WC">William Combe</persName> (<date notBefore="1742" notAfter="1823">1742&#x2013;1823</date>). 
                        <persName corresp="#WC">Combe</persName> was well known as the author of

                        This illustrated work ranked among the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm&#x02BC;s greatest best&#x2010;sellers 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FORDACKERMANN"><persName corresp="#JFORD">Ford</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#FORDACKERMANN"><hi rend="italic">Ackermann</hi></title></ref>, 52&#x2013;60);

                        was probably striving to maintain this popularity.
                    </p>
                    <p>In some respects, however, the illustrated emblems of the months in <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName>&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> 
                        looked backward to an <date notBefore="1701" notAfter="1800">eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> tradition, rather than forward to new fashions. Copper engraving 
                        was soon to be displaced by more durable steel engraving, which would allow for much larger press runs; and the very inclusion of a monthly calendar hearkened 
                        to the gift annual&#x02BC;s beginnings in the eighteenth&#x2010;century &#x201C;pocket book&#x201D; 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</ref>). 
                        The second volume of <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title>, featured much more varied pictorial scenes (albeit with mausoleums predominating), 
                        which were highlighted in the front matter by a list of plates 
                        that stood separately from the literary table of contents. The dual tables of contents&#x2014;emblematic of the growing importance of visual culture in the early Victorian period&#x2014;remained typical of annuals thereafter 
                        (see the facsimiles of <title type="archive" corresp="#HARRISFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> available in

                        this plate would have numbered among the early steel engravings produced by the <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="finden_brothers_note.php">Finden brothers</ref> 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED">Hunnisett, <title type="essay" corresp="#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED"><hi rend="italic">Steel&#x2010;Engraved Book Illustration in England</hi></title></ref>, 84&#x2013;85). 
                        <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName>&#x02BC;s annual had now caught up with the technology of steel engraving for book illustration, 
                        which proved key to the success of all the annuals. As compared with softer copper, which soon lost its edge in repeated impressions, 
                        steel engraving made possible the mass production of images, and helped to satisfy the craving for pervasive, but affordable visual culture by the early&#x2010;Victorian middle class. 
                        These developments coincided with <persName corresp="#AE">Alexander Elder</persName>&#x02BC;s ambitions for <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>.
                    </p>
                    <p><orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> benefited by these early, rapid developments in the annual as a commodity. 
                        Its binding was more sumptuous, and the engraving sharper and more consistent. At the same time, 
                        a comparison of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>&#x02BC;s product with the volumes published by the annual&#x02BC;s creator, <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>, 
                        suggests that the new firm attempted to keep the interior uniform with earlier volumes, at least initially. 
                        <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> did expand the title, however, from <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName>&#x02BC;s <title type="anthology" corresp="RELFEFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering: A Literary Album</hi></title> to 
                        <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering: A Literary Album and Annual Remembrancer</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A Literary Album, and Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present</hi>.  
                        In <date when="1833">1833</date>, the title changed again, the annual having absorbed another existing publication, <hi rend="italic">Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</hi>, 
                        which had been published in <placeName corresp="#LIVERPOOL">Liverpool</placeName> since <date when="1828">1828</date>. This merger resulted in the title, 
                        <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</hi> (so the title appears on the typeset title page; 
                        for a time, the engraved frontispiece with the earlier title remained in production). 
                        This latest title was in use when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first appeared in the annual, in the issue, 
                        <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath: A Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present for <hi rend="smallcaps">MDCCCXXXV</hi></hi></title>.

                        for producing fine illustrated books that <persName corresp="#CTR">Charles</persName> &#x201C;on Sundays always brought a volume or two in his pocket
