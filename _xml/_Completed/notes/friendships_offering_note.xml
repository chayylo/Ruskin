                        The Ruskin family had some awareness of this early stage of the annual, since the volume for 1825, Relfe's second volume in the series, came into the family library 
                        with an inscription to <!-- TAG FOR BIO NOTE -->Mary Richardson (1815-49), Ruskin's cousin who first came to Camberwell to live with the family in 1827

                        <p>As <persName corresp="#KDH">Katherine D. Harris</persName> remarks, Relfe's first volume, for 1824, appeared only one year after the very first of the British annuals,

                        Harris transcribes the preface of this debut volume of Friendship's Offering and details the volume's contents, revealing a derivative and miscellaneous assemblage that exposes <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName> 
                        as aspiring only to mimic and capitalize on Ackermann's achievement. He had formed no clear conception of his production, which mixes features of the literary annual with the almanac and the eighteenth&#x2010;century &#x201C;pocket book&#x201D;

                        To become successful, <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> needed to shed the miscellaneous features derived from its early models and to define its niche in the market. 
                        Its shortcomings were acknowledged by the editor, <persName corresp="#TKH">T. K. Hervey</persName> (<date notBefore="1799" notAfter="1859">1799&#x2013;1859</date>), 
                        in his prefatory remarks for the <date when="1826">1826</date> volume: pleading &#x201C;difficulties&#x201D; that arose from the publication having, only &#x201C;very recently, come into the present Editor&#x02BC;s hands" 
                        (<persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName> had in fact edited the title since <date when="1824">1824</date>), he announced "a view to an entire change in . . . [the annual's] character and plan&#x201D;. 
                        He proposed &#x201C;alterations . . . consist[ing] in the removal of all those features which marked it as more peculiarly adapted for one season of the year than another&#x201d;, 
                        with the aim instead of &#x201C;combining, with the increased beauty of its embellishments, a high literary character&#x201d; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName>, ed., <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> [<date when="1826">1826</date>]</ref>, v, vi).</p>
                    <p>With this <date when="1826">1826</date> volume, the hodgepodge of features such as blank calendar pages, informational charts, and sheet music that, according to <persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, had cluttered the first volume, did fall away 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title></ref>, 126). 
                        In order "to create a more marketable" item, Frienship's Offering became a "completely prefabricated book of printed memories", albeit at the cost of the 
                        "album-like qualities" that allowed both the giver and the recipient to personalize the volume with inscriptions 
                        (Harris, "Feminizing the Textual Body", 607). The improved "literary character" promised by Hervey is adumbrated in the 1826 volume 
                        with contributions by the likes of L.E.L. (Letitia Landon, 1802-38), James Montgomery (1771-1854), and Ruskin's future Camberwell schoolmaster, 
                        the Reverend Thomas Dale (1797-1870).</p>
                    
                        <div type="sub-subsection" xml:id="RELFEILLUSTRATION">
                            <head type="sub-subsection">Illustration in the <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName> Annual</head>
                            
                        <p>The 1826 volume is embellished by few engravings compared to the later, robustly pictorial standards for the annual under the Smith, Elder propretorship. 
                        The pairings of picture and poem are marked, however, by a consistently Romantic-era transformation of the <hi rend="italic">ut pictura poesis</hi> aesthetic, 
                            which Roy Park characterizes as an abandonment of the worn pictorialism of the eighteenth century 
                        in favor of a view of the sister arts as "twin facets of a unified poetic experience" (Park, "'Ut Pictura Poesis': The Nineteenth-Century Aftermath", 156). 
                        Ekphrastic poems in the volume pay tribute to a shared poetic experience. For example, in a poem accompanying an engraving of a Claude landscape, 
                        the speaker declines to engage in the traditional contest between poet and painter, the rivalry of the Renaissance paragone: 
                        "I feel / No envy of thy noble art, / . . . which, unto outward sense, / Speaks in a language so refined" 
                        (Bernard Barton, "'Am I, Too, in Arcadia?'"). A similar strategy is adopted in a poem by L.E.L. to accompany an engraving of 
                        <title type="artwork" corresp="BERGERETRAPHAELONHISDEATHBED"><hi rend="italic">Honors Rendered to Raphael on his Deathbed</hi></title> (1806) 
                            by the French painter in the Troubadour style, Pierre Nolasque Bergeret (1782-1863). 
                            Awarding immortality to the sister art, L.E.L.'s speaker marvels how, despite the "face of death" that leaves Raphael "paler and colder than the marble bust", 
                            there can be no departure of the artist's "soul" that "leave[s] its influence on the heart!" 
                        (L.E.L., "Raphael's Death-Bed").</p>
                            <p>Feebler pictures are showcased in the 1826 volume with engravings after Richard Westall (1765-1836), 
                        including the frontispiece which illustrates a poem by the editor; however, the intrinsic merit of the pictures probably mattered less to consumers of Friendship's Offering 
                        than did recognition of Westall's reputation, who was known for his numerous illustrations of Romantic-era poetry and for his evocative portraits of Byron. 
                        As an 1824 tribute to Westall effused, his work embodied the "poetic" spirit unifying the sister arts: he was the ideal portraitist of Byron, since 
                        "Thou saw'st the poet, with a poet's eye, / And hence a poet's mind could well descry, / For thou, to graphic genius not confin'd, / Can'st boast the pow'rs of a poetic mind" 
                        (John Taylor [1757-1832], "Lines on the Portrait of the Late Lord Byron, Painted by Richard Westall, Esq. RA") 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName>, ed., <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> [<date when="1826">1826</date>]</ref>, 47-48, 73-75;

  <!-- RESUME TAGGING -->   was complimented by the <title type="periodical" corresp="#MONTHLYREVIEW">Monthly Review</title> on his success with the 1828 volume: "considering the advanced period of the season when his duties commenced", 
                        Knight had collected "a sufficient number" of literary pieces "readable enough . . . to wile away an hour or two of a winter's evening". Faint praise, but the reviewer was more impressed by the quality of illustration: 
                        the plates were "really very creditable to the publishers", their "subjects . . . selected with great judgment" and "engraved in a chaste, artist-like style"

                        <p><persName corresp="#CK">Knight</persName> was succeeded by <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="pringle_thomas_note.php"><persName corresp="#TP">Thomas Pringle</persName></ref>. 
                            A regular visitor to Herne Hill, it was Pringle who introduced <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to the fashionable literary world as the author &#x201C;<persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JR">J.R.</persName>&#x201D; 
                            As a native Scotsman like the annual's proprietors, Pringle had begun a literary career in Edinburgh, but like many Scots he emigrated to the Cape Colony in <placeName corresp="#SOUTHAFRICA">South Africa</placeName>, 
                            which Britain acquired as a possession in the Congress of Vienna. Failing to gain advancement there, on return he renewed his northern literary connections, 
                            thus lending to the 1829 Friendship's Offering a decided Caledonian emphasis.</p>
                        
                        <p>Under Knight, Frienship's Offering in 1828 featured fewer than five contributions by Scottish writers, 
                            including Pringle and Allan Cunningham (1784-1842). Under Pringle, the volume for 1829 presented over thirty contributions by Scots--more than a third of the total--including such poems as 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="GIBSONCORONACH">"The Highland Hunter's Coronach"</title> and <title type="poem" corresp="KENNEDYLEAVINGSCOTLAND">"On Leaving Scotland"</title>, 
                            such tales as "The Covenanters: A Scottish Traditionary Tale". The roster also includes a "German legend" and an "Irish tale", and the editor did not draw attention to the Scotch emphasis in his preface. 
                            There may have been some risk. Published the same year, the short-lived annual The Anniversary, edited by Allan Cunningham, was advised by the Monthly Review to rein in the Celtic contributions, 
                            since "a beautiful work of art" required that "all the parts shall be in unison"; and without "mean[ing] to insinuate any dislike of the true Doric dialect, 
                            as it has been called, of Scotland", the reviewer advised that "in every instance the current language of England . . . prevail in the literature of the Annuals". 
                            The reviewer particularly objected to selections by the Church of Scotland clergyman, Edward Irving (1792-1834), given to a "'puritanic . . . phraseology, 
                            which literary persons belonging to that sect are too much in the habit of using on all occasions". In contrast, as an example of "neatly written essays on popular subjects", 
                            the reviewer quoted at length from The Anniversary's "essay on the Female Beauty of the Three Kingdoms", which discovers that female beauty is independent of nation, found wherever 
                            "gentleness of her nature and the kindliness of her heart throw a household halo around her person" 
                            (Unsigned review of The Anniversary (1829), The Amulet (1829), The Juvenile Forget Me Not (1829), and The Juvenile Keepsake (1829), 526, 530; 
                            M. "English, Scotch, and Irish Beauty", in Cunningham, ed., The Anniversary, 201-5, 205). The tendency of writers for the Monthly Review to denigrate authors for nonstandard English reached back to the journal's origins in the eighteenth century

                            <p>Whereas Relfe inclined to Old Masters, Smith, Elder advertised that their debut volume would feature engravings taken from recently exhibited paintings 
                                as well as art "painted expressly for the Work". Presumably, by drawing on recent exhibition, the annual claimed both institutional legitimacy and popular favor. 
                                The frontispiece for 1828, <title type="artwork" corresp="#WOODSYLPH"><hi rend="italic">A Sylph</hi></title>, 
                                reproduced a painting "exhibited at Somerset House, in 1827"

                                The artist was a history painter, John Wood (1801-70), who had recently gained recognition at the Royal Academy for such works as

                                For 1829, Wood created a frontispiece "expressly for this work",

                                Wood's mildly erotic fancy pictures of classical subjects continued to occupy frontispieces and other placements for 1830 (frontispiece

                            <p>A Scottish emphasis is evident in the embellishments for the 1829 Friendship's Offering, Pringle's first volume, just as in the literary contributions; 
                            however, the frontmatter seems designed to assure continuity with the genre of the literary album, highlighting the same Romantic-era adaptation of <hi rend="italic">ut pictura poesis</hi> 
                            as found in Relfe's volume 26. A dedicatory poem presents a female recipient, the "Lady of the Book", 
                            with this "album" as a "fair enclosure" uniting the sister arts in "quintessence of Po&#x00EB;sy" 
                            (James Montgomery, "The First Leaf of an Album"). The frontispiece, "painted . . . expressly for this work", is a classical subject, 
                            , just as volume 26 had gravitated to Old Masters. 
                            The artist, "J. Wood", was probably the history painter . This gateway to the volume's sister-arts experience appears consistent with Smith, Elder's debut volume, for 1828, 
                            which opened with "A Sylph <title type="periodical" corresp="#MIRROROFLITERATURE"><hi rend="italic">The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction</hi></title> 
                                described as "a chaste and classical specimen of a kind of gold enamel engraving" along with a figure entitled "A Sylph

                                a "landscape with ruins, designed and engraved for this work by John Martin". Rendered in Martin's (1789-1854) typically sublime style, 
                                the picture overwhelms its homely pairing, the poem "Glen-Lynden: A Tale of Teviotdale" by the volume editor. 
                                (Pringle preferred the traditional name <hi rend="italic">Teviotdale</hi> for the valley of the Teviot River near Kelso in Roxburghshire, where he was born. 
                                The name <hi rend="italic">Glen Lynden</hi>, although used here for a fictional Border glen, was in real life the name Pringle bestowed on the settlement in Cape Colony, where he emigrated 
                                [Vigne, Thomas Pringle, 79].) Another plate on the theme of Scottish landscape with ruins features Campbell Castle in the Ochil Hills, 
                                drawn by George Arnald (1763-1841) and supported by a poem by David Macbeth Moir ("Delta", 1798-1851).

                        The first volume of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> under the new proprietorship received a complimentary notice in

                        the review focusing first on the &#x201C;exterior, which is somewhat novel in taste, . . . by substituting for the usual paper covering

                        This is altogether an improvement on the original plan, since the slight coverings of silk or paper is scarcely safe out of the drawing&#x2010;room or boudoir, 
                        and some of the contributions to the &#x2018;annuals&#x2019; entitle them to a higher stand&#x201D;

                        By the &#x201C;original plan&#x201D;, the writer refers apparently to the binding used by <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>, 
                        which consisted of glazed paper boards, printed with a decorative and typographic cover, in imitation of the binding used for the <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title>

                        The new binding of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> featured an arabesque design that was blind embossed into the full surface of the dark leather cover, 
                        with a lyre design blocked in gilt in the center of the front cover. As <persName corresp="#EJ">Eleanore Jamieson</persName> remarks in

                        the arabesque pattern was regarded as a revival style hearkening to the early book, and the style was associated with Continental models
                        (p. 11; and see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</ref>).</p>
                    
                    <p>The annuals dueled to be judged by their covers, the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> having set an initial standard with its printed and glazed paper boards, 
                        cloth spine, and slipcase, later replaced by a silk cover

                        Innovation and extravagance&#x2014;or at least the appearance of extravagance&#x2014;in bindings and engraved or lithographed front matter became characteristic of annuals, 
                        which used this immediate source of appeal to compete in a crowded market 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FAXONLITERARYANNUALS">Faxon, <title type="bibliography" corresp="FAXONLITERARYANNUALS"><hi rend="italic">Literary Annuals</hi></title></ref>, xiv&#x2013;xvi). 
                        Mechanization brought these material appeals within reach of the ordinary consumer; and mass&#x2010;produced fancy bindings in particular 
                        shifted traditional division of labor, since publishers took on the economic burden of bookbinding, which conventionally had been borne by the consumer.
                        <persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName> also speculates that the annuals&#x02BC; elaborately embossed leather covers suggested the bindings of prayer books and bibles&#x2014;the only other expensively 
                        bound stock that retailers typically offered over the counter (as opposed to cheap temporary bindings, to be replaced by the consumer). 
                        These &#x201C;gospel&#x2010;like bindings&#x201D; may have been meant &#x201C;to convince the reading public of the wholesome value of the literature and engravings within&#x201D;

                        Perhaps the comment in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#MIRROROFLITERATURE"><hi rend="italic">Mirror of Literature</hi></title> that the sturdier cover 
                        of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> matched its more substantial content inside, capable of subsisting beyond the lady&#x02BC;s boudoir, 
                        gestured at an audience that expanded to include, not just male readers, but the entire family gathered in the parlor.</p>
                        
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <p><orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> benefited by these early, rapid developments in the annual as a commodity. 
                        Its binding was more sumptuous, and the engraving sharper and more consistent. To mark these improvements, <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> expanded the subtitle, 
                        from <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName>&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="RELFEFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering: A Literary Album</hi></title> to 
                        <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering: A Literary Album and Annual Remembrancer</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A Literary Album, and Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present</hi>.  
                        In <date when="1833">1833</date>, the title changed again, the annual having absorbed another existing publication, <hi rend="italic">Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</hi>, 
                        which had been published in <placeName corresp="#LIVERPOOL">Liverpool</placeName> since <date when="1828">1828</date>. This merger resulted in the title, 
                        <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</hi> (so the title appears on the typeset title page; 
                        for a time, the engraved frontispiece with the earlier title remained in production). 
                        This latest title was in use when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first appeared in the annual, in the issue, 
                        <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath: A Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present for <hi rend="smallcaps">MDCCCXXXV</hi></hi></title>.
                    </p>
                    <p>At the same time, a comparison of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>&#x02BC;s product with the volumes published by the annual&#x02BC;s creator, <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>, 
                        suggests that the new firm attempted to keep the interior uniform with earlier volumes, at least initially. 
                        As remarked about the 1826 volume edited by Hervey for Relfe, the annual was already responsive to the "poetic" sensibility that unified the sister arts during that period. . . </p>
