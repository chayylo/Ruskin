                    <p>The first volume of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> appeared with the date <date when="1824">1824</date>,

                        The Ruskin family had some awareness of this early stage of the annual, since the volume for 1825, Relfe's second volume in the series, came into the family library 
                        with an inscription to <!-- TAG FOR BIO NOTE -->Mary Richardson (1815-49), Ruskin's cousin who first came to Camberwell to live with the family in 1827 
                        (Dearden, Library of John Ruskin, 122 [no. 953]; and for specific features of the 1825 Friendship's Offering, see Harris, "Feminizing the Textual Body", 601-2, 611). 
                        As <persName corresp="#KDH">Katherine D. Harris</persName> remarks, Relfe's first volume, for 1824, appeared only one year after the very first of the British annuals, 
                        <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi> (<date when="1823">1823</date>)</title>, 
                        was released by the firm of <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Rudolf Ackermann</orgName> in <date when="1822">1822</date> for the holiday season of <date notBefore="1822-11" notAfter="1823-02">1822&#x2013;23</date>. 
                        Harris transcribes the preface of this debut volume of Friendship's Offering and details the volume's contents, revealing a derivative and miscellaneous assemblage that exposes <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName> 
                        as aspiring only to mimic and capitalize on Ackermann's achievement. He had formed no clear conception of his production, which mixes features of the literary annual with the almanac and the eighteenth&#x2010;century &#x201C;pocket book&#x201D;

                        To become successful, <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> needed to shed the miscellaneous features derived from its early models and to define its niche in the market. 
                        Its shortcomings were acknowledged by the editor, <persName corresp="#TKH">T. K. Hervey</persName> (<date notBefore="1799" notAfter="1859">1799&#x2013;1859</date>), 
                        in his prefatory remarks for the <date when="1826">1826</date> volume: pleading &#x201C;difficulties&#x201D; that arose from the publication having, only &#x201C;very recently, come into the present Editor&#x02BC;s hands" 
                        (<persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName> had in fact edited the title since <date when="1824">1824</date>), he announced "a view to an entire change in . . . [the annual's] character and plan&#x201D;. 
                        He proposed &#x201C;alterations . . . consist[ing] in the removal of all those features which marked it as more peculiarly adapted for one season of the year than another&#x201d;, 
                        with the aim instead of &#x201C;combining, with the increased beauty of its embellishments, a high literary character&#x201d; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName>, ed., <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> [<date when="1826">1826</date>]</ref>, v, vi).</p>
                    <p>With this <date when="1826">1826</date> volume, the hodgepodge of features such as blank calendar pages, informational charts, and sheet music that, according to <persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, had cluttered the first volume, did fall away 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title></ref>, 126). 
                        In order "to create a more marketable" item, Frienship's Offering became a "completely prefabricated book of printed memories", albeit at the cost of the 
                        "album-like qualities" that allowed both the giver and the recipient to personalize the volume with inscriptions 
                        (Harris, "Feminizing the Textual Body", 607). The improved "literary character" promised by Hervey is adumbrated in the 1826 volume 
                        with contributions by the likes of L.E.L. (Letitia Landon, 1802-38), James Montgomery (1771-1854), and Ruskin's future Camberwell schoolmaster, 
                        the Reverend Thomas Dale (1797-1870).</p>

                        <p>The 1826 volume is embellished by few engravings compared to the later, robustly pictorial standards for the annual under the Smith, Elder propretorship. 
                        The pairings of picture and poem are marked, however, by a consistently Romantic-era transformation of the <hi rend="italic">ut pictura poesis</hi> aesthetic, 
                            which Roy Park characterizes as an abandonment of the worn pictorialism of the eighteenth century 
                        in favor of a view of the sister arts as "twin facets of a unified poetic experience" (Park, "'Ut Pictura Poesis': The Nineteenth-Century Aftermath", 156). 
                        Ekphrastic poems in the volume pay tribute to a shared poetic experience. For example, in a poem accompanying an engraving of a Claude landscape, 
                        the speaker declines to engage in the traditional contest between poet and painter, the rivalry of the Renaissance paragone: 
                        "I feel / No envy of thy noble art, / . . . which, unto outward sense, / Speaks in a language so refined" 
                        (Bernard Barton, "'Am I, Too, in Arcadia?'"). A similar strategy is adopted in a poem by L.E.L. to accompany an engraving of 
                        <title type="artwork" corresp="BERGERETRAPHAELONHISDEATHBED"><hi rend="italic">Honors Rendered to Raphael on his Deathbed</hi></title> (1806) 
                            by the French painter in the Troubadour style, Pierre Nolasque Bergeret (1782-1863). 
                            Awarding immortality to the sister art, L.E.L.'s speaker marvels how, despite the "face of death" that leaves Raphael "paler and colder than the marble bust", 
                            there can be no departure of the artist's "soul" that "leave[s] its influence on the heart!" 
                        (L.E.L., "Raphael's Death-Bed").</p>
                            <p>Feebler pictures are showcased in the 1826 volume with engravings after Richard Westall (1765-1836), 
                        including the frontispiece which illustrates a poem by the editor; however, the intrinsic merit of the pictures probably mattered less to consumers of Friendship's Offering 
                        than did recognition of Westall's reputation, who was known for his numerous illustrations of Romantic-era poets and for his evocative portraits of Byron. 
                        As an 1824 tribute to Westall effused, his work embodied the "poetic" spirit unifying the sister arts: he was the ideal portraitist of Byron, since 
                        "Thou saw'st the poet, with a poet's eye, / And hence a poet's mind could well descry, / For thou, to graphic genius not confin'd, / Can'st boast the pow'rs of a poetic mind" 
                        (John Taylor [1757-1832], "Lines on the Portrait of the Late Lord Byron, Painted by Richard Westall, Esq. RA") 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName>, ed., <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> [<date when="1826">1826</date>]</ref>, 47-48, 73-75;

                            According to the biographer of the firm, <persName corresp="#LHUXLEY">Leonard Huxley</persName>, <persName corresp="#AE">Elder</persName> was interested in art, and aspired to produce elegantly illustrated publications

                            It was not only the quality of the engravings but also their character, which was influenced presumably by Elder as well as by the editor who succeeded

                            A poet and an activist in the <orgName corresp="#ANTISLAVERYSOCIETY">Anti&#x2010;Slavery Society</orgName>, Pringle had recently returned from disappointed hopes of advancement in <placeName corresp="#SOUTHAFRICA">South Africa</placeName>. 
                            He was also a native Scotsman like the proprietors, and the pictorial embellishments along with the literary contributions to Friendship's Offering took on a decided Caledonian emphasis.  
                            The change was doubtless a pleasurable one to John James Ruskin, who made <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> a regular visitor to Herne Hill. It was Pringle, accordingly, 
                            who later introduced <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to the fashionable literary world as the author &#x201C;<persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JR">J.R.</persName>&#x201D;</p>
                        
                        <p>Under Knight, the 1828 volume of Frienship's Offering featured fewer than five contributions by Scottish writers, including Pringle and Allan Cunningham (1784-1842). 
                            The 1829 volume, under Pringle, offered over thirty contributions by Scots--more than a third of the total--including such poems as 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="GIBSONCORONACH">"The Highland Hunter's Coronach</title>, <title type="poem" corresp="KENNEDYLEAVINGSCOTLAND">"On Leaving Scotland"</title>, 
                            such tales as 
                            "The Covenanters: A Scottish Traditionary Tale". There are also a "German legend" and an "Irish tale", and a Scots emphasis is not declared in the editor's preface; 
                            in fact, the frontmatter seems designed to assure continuity with the genre of the literary album. A dedicatory poem presents a female recipient, the "Lady of the Book", 
                            with this "album" as a "fair enclosure" uniting the Sister Arts in "quintessence of Po&#x00EB;sy" (James Montgomery, "The First Leaf of an Album")--the same Romantic-era adaptation of <hi rend="italic">ut pictura poesis</hi> 
                            as found in Relfe's volume 26. The frontispiece, "painted . . . expressly for this work", is a classical subject, 
                            <title type="artwork" corresp="#WOODPSYCHEANDCUPID"><hi rend="italic">Psyche and Cupid</hi></title>, just as volume 26 gravitated to Old Masters. 
                            (The artist, "J. Wood", was probably the history painter John Wood [1801-70], who had recently gained recognition at the Royal Academy for such works as 
                            <hi rend="italic">Psyche Conveyed by Zephyrs to the Valley of Pleasure</hi> [1826; Sir John Soane's Museum, London]; see 
                            Cooper, "Wood, John [1801-1870]".). Nonetheless, a Caledonian thread runs through the annual, introduced early and prominently by a "landscape with ruins, 
                            designed and engraved for this work by John Martin". Rendered in Martin's typically sublime style, the picture overwhelms its homely pairing, 
                            the poem "Glen-Lynden: A Tale of Teviotdale" by the volume editor. (Pringle preferred the traditional name <hi rend="italic">Teviotdale</hi> 
                            for the valley of the Teviot River near Kelso in Roxburghshire, where he was born. The name <hi rend="italic">Glen Lynden</hi>, 
                            although used here for a fictional a Border glen, was in real life the name Pringle bestowed on the settlement in Cape Colony, South Africa, where he emigrated 
                            [Vigne, Thomas Pringle, 79].) Another plate on the theme of Scottish landscape with ruins features Campbell Castle in the Ochil Hills, 
                            drawn by George Arnald (1763-1841) and supported by a poem by David Macbeth Moir ("Delta", 1798-1851). 
                            The Ochils were known to Ruskin from the family's journeys north to Perth via <!-- place name plus link to note

                            This illustrated work ranked among the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm&#x02BC;s greatest best&#x2010;sellers

                        The first volume of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> under the new proprietorship received a complimentary notice in  
                        <title type="periodical" corresp="#MIRROROFLITERATURE"><hi rend="italic">The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction</hi></title>, 
                        the review focusing first on the &#x201C;exterior, which is somewhat novel in taste, . . . by substituting for the usual paper covering 
                        [i.e., like the printed paper boards then covering the <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title>], an elegantly embossed leather binding. 
                        This is altogether an improvement on the original plan, since the slight coverings of silk or paper is scarcely safe out of the drawing&#x2010;room or boudoir, 
                        and some of the contributions to the &#x2018;annuals&#x2019; entitle them to a higher stand&#x201D;
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SPIRITOFTHEANNUALS"><title type="periodical" corresp="#MIRROROFLITERATURE">&#x201C;Spirit of &#x2018;The Annuals&#x2019; for 1828&#x201D;</title></ref>, 418). 
                        By the &#x201C;original plan&#x201D;, the writer refers apparently to the binding used by <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>, 
                        which consisted of glazed paper boards, printed with a decorative and typographic cover, in imitation of the binding used for the <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> 
                        (the latter already moving to silk; see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title></ref>, 133).
                        The new binding of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> featured an arabesque design that was blind embossed into the full surface of the dark leather cover, 
                        with a lyre design blocked in gilt in the center of the front cover. As <persName corresp="#EJ">Eleanore Jamieson</persName> remarks in 
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JAMIESONBINDINGSTYLES"><title type="essay"  corresp="#JAMIESONBINDINGSTYLES">&#x201C;The Binding Styles of the Gift Books and Annuals&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        the arabesque pattern was regarded as a revival style hearkening to the early book, and the style was associated with Continental models
                        (p. 11; and see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</ref>).</p>
                    
                    <p>The annuals dueled to be judged by their covers, the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> having set an initial standard with its printed and glazed paper boards, 
                        cloth spine, and slipcase, later replaced by a silk cover 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FORDACKERMANN"><persName corresp="#JFORD">Ford</persName>, <title type="biography" corresp="#FORDACKERMAN"><hi rend="italic">Ackermann</hi></title></ref>, 65).  
                        Innovation and extravagance&#x2014;or at least the appearance of extravagance&#x2014;in bindings and engraved or lithographed front matter became characteristic of annuals, 
                        which used this immediate source of appeal to compete in a crowded market 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FAXONLITERARYANNUALS">Faxon, <title type="bibliography" corresp="FAXONLITERARYANNUALS"><hi rend="italic">Literary Annuals</hi></title></ref>, xiv&#x2013;xvi). 
                        Mechanization brought these material appeals within reach of the ordinary consumer; and mass&#x2010;produced fancy bindings in particular 
                        shifted traditional division of labor, since publishers took on the economic burden of bookbinding, which conventionally had been borne by the consumer.
                        <persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName> also speculates that the annuals&#x02BC; elaborately embossed leather covers suggested the bindings of prayer books and bibles&#x2014;the only other expensively 
                        bound stock that retailers typically offered over the counter (as opposed to cheap temporary bindings, to be replaced by the consumer). 
                        These &#x201C;gospel&#x2010;like bindings&#x201D; may have been meant &#x201C;to convince the reading public of the wholesome value of the literature and engravings within&#x201D;

                        Perhaps the comment in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#MIRROROFLITERATURE"><hi rend="italic">Mirror of Literature</hi></title> that the sturdier cover 
                        of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> matched its more substantial content inside, capable of subsisting beyond the lady&#x02BC;s boudoir,

                        looked backward, however, to an <date notBefore="1701" notAfter="1800">eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> tradition, rather than forward to new fashions. Copper engraving 
                        was soon to be displaced by more durable steel engraving, which would allow for much larger press runs; and the very inclusion of a monthly calendar hearkened

                        that stood separately from the literary table of contents. The dual tables of contents&#x2014;emblematic of the growing importance of visual culture in the early Victorian period&#x2014;remained typical of annuals thereafter

                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED">Hunnisett, <title type="essay" corresp="#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED"><hi rend="italic">Steel&#x2010;Engraved Book Illustration in England</hi></title></ref>, 84&#x2013;85). 
                        <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName>&#x02BC;s annual had now caught up with the technology of steel engraving for book illustration, 
                        which proved key to the success of all the annuals. As compared with softer copper, which soon lost its edge in repeated impressions, 
                        steel engraving made possible the mass production of images, and helped to satisfy the craving for pervasive, but affordable visual culture by the early&#x2010;Victorian middle class. 
                        These developments coincided with <persName corresp="#AE">Alexander Elder</persName>&#x02BC;s ambitions for <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>.
                    </p>
                    <p><orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> benefited by these early, rapid developments in the annual as a commodity. 
                        Its binding was more sumptuous, and the engraving sharper and more consistent. To mark these improvements, <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> expanded the subtitle, 
                        from <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName>&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="RELFEFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering: A Literary Album</hi></title> to 
                        <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering: A Literary Album and Annual Remembrancer</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A Literary Album, and Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present</hi>.  
                        In <date when="1833">1833</date>, the title changed again, the annual having absorbed another existing publication, <hi rend="italic">Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</hi>, 
                        which had been published in <placeName corresp="#LIVERPOOL">Liverpool</placeName> since <date when="1828">1828</date>. This merger resulted in the title, 
                        <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</hi> (so the title appears on the typeset title page; 
                        for a time, the engraved frontispiece with the earlier title remained in production). 
                        This latest title was in use when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first appeared in the annual, in the issue, 
                        <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath: A Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present for <hi rend="smallcaps">MDCCCXXXV</hi></hi></title>.
                    </p>
                    <p>At the same time, a comparison of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>&#x02BC;s product with the volumes published by the annual&#x02BC;s creator, <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>, 
                        suggests that the new firm attempted to keep the interior uniform with earlier volumes, at least initially. 
                        As remarked about the 1826 volume edited by Hervey for Relfe, the annual was already responsive to the "poetic" sensibility that unified the sister arts during that period. . . </p>
