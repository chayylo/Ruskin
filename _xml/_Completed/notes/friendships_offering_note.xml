                            <p>As <persName corresp="#KDH">Katherine D. Harris</persName> remarks, <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName>&#x02BC;s first volume, for <date when="1824">1824</date>, appeared only one year after the very first of the British annuals,

                                as aspiring only to mimic and capitalize on <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName>&#x02BC;s achievement.

                            <p><orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName>&#x02BC;s inclusion of pocket&#x2010;book features such as blank diary pages did not necessarily suggest incoherence: as <persName corresp="#SLODGE">Sara Lodge</persName> has noted, during the post&#x2010;Waterloo period <persName corresp="#JHLH">Leigh Hunt</persName> 
                                produced an item, the <hi rend="italic">Literary Pocket&#x2010;Book</hi> (<date notBefore="1818" notAfter="1822">1818&#x2013;22</date>), which invited the consumer to inscribe poetic effusions on a blank "&#x201C;Calendar of Nature&#x201D;, thus activating the reader to put literary response to use in constructing, as <persName corresp="#JHLH">Hunt</persName> put it, 
                                &#x201C;a sort of Court Calendar&#x201D; of one&#x02BC;s own (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LODGEROMANTICRELIQUARIES"><persName corresp="#SLODGE">Lodge</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#LODGEROMANTICRELIQUARIES">&#x201C;Romantic Reliquaries&#x201D;</title></ref>, 25). Nonetheless, <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName> initially seems to have had trouble positioning his annual to respond to the conflicting audience demands of the transitional, post&#x2010;Waterloo period. 
                                In <date when="1858">1858</date>, when the history of the annuals began to be written following their decline in popularity, an article in the <hi rend="italic">Bookseller</hi> settled on the opinion that <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> 
                                was characterized by an &#x201C;unpromising&#x201D; mix of &#x201C;ruled pages for memoranda&#x201D; with &#x201C;indifferent views of Continental cities&#x201D;, &#x201C;poor verses&#x201D;, and the occasional &#x201C;tale by <persName corresp="#AO">Mrs. Opie</persName>&#x201D; (i.e., <persName corresp="#AO">Amelia Opie</persName> [<date notBefore="1769" notAfter="1853">1769&#x2013;1853</date>]) 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ANNUALSOFFORMERDAYS"><title type="annual" corresp="#ANNUALSOFFORMERDAYS">&#x201C;The Annuals of Former Days&#x201D;</title></ref>, 496).</p>
                        
                    <p>According to the Bookseller article, the fortunes of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> were turned around by 
                        by the editorship of <persName corresp="#TKH">T. K. Hervey</persName> (<date notBefore="1799" notAfter="1859">1799&#x2013;1859</date>). 
                        In his prefatory remarks for <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1826">1826</date> volume, <persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName> did announce &#x201C;a view to an entire change in . . . [the annual&#x02BC;s] character and plan&#x201D;, 
                        shifting emphasis from the transience of an annual to the permanence of a keepsake: the &#x201C;alterations&#x201D; were to &#x201C;consist in the removal of all those features which marked it as more peculiarly adapted for one season of the year than another&#x201D; 
                        (directly echoing an <date when="1825">1825</date> <title type="periodical" corresp="#MONTHLYREVIEW"><hi rend="italic">Monthly Review</hi></title> article that praised British annuals over their Continental precursors for &#x201C;exclud[ing] every feature which would seem to attach them to one year more than to another&#x201D; 
                        [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#REVIEWLITERARYSOUVENIR1825"><title type="essay" corresp="#REVIEWLITERARYSOUVENIR1825">Unsigned review of <hi rend="italic">Literary Souvenir</hi></title> (<date when="1825">1825</date>)</ref>, 279]; see also 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php#CHARACTER">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books: The Character and Reception of the Annuals</ref>). 
                        Instead, <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> would become a more permanent, treasurable item, &#x201C;combining, with the increased beauty of its embellishments, a high literary character&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName>, ed., <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> [<date when="1826">1826</date>]</ref>, vi). 
                        Thus, according to <persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, the pocket&#x2010;book features of <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName>&#x02BC;s earlier volumes such as blank calendar pages, informational charts, and even notated music fell away 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title></ref>, 126); and 
                        while these earlier &#x201C;album&#x2010;like qualities&#x201D; did have the merit of allowing the giver and the recipient to personalize the volume with their own inscriptions, 
                        a &#x201C;more marketable&#x201D; item emerged for the period, one that required the annual to became a &#x201C;completely prefabricated book of printed memories&#x201D;

                                presumably because the number of plates was limited not only by the expense of commissioning artists and engravers but also by the availability of space between text signatures for insertion of plates.

                        <persName corresp="#AWEDITOR">Watts</persName>&#x02BC;s volume presented a steel&#x2010;engraved view of the <placeName corresp="#THAMES">Thames</placeName> by <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>, <title type="artwork" corresp="#JMWTRICHMONDHILL"><hi rend="italic">Richmond Hill</hi></title>, which, like <persName corresp="#RPB">Bonington</persName>&#x02BC;s view of the <placeName corresp="#SEINE">Seine</placeName>, pictured a river prospect from a high vantage. 
                                    The rivalry between the annuals thus reflected the aspirations of the young French Romantic artists who, at just this time, were visiting <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> 
                                    to study the modern British landscape school.</p>
                    
                    <p><persName corresp="#RPB">R. P. Bonington</persName>, the son of an &#x00E9;migr&#x00E9; British artist from <placeName corresp="#NOTTINGHAM">Nottingham</placeName> living in <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>, received his training in the atelier 
                        of <persName corresp="#AJG">Baron Antoine&#x2010;Jean Gros</persName> (<date notBefore="1771" notAfter="1835">1771&#x2013;1835</date>). To a neoclassicist such as <persName corresp="#AJG">Gros</persName> and the influential artist and critic <persName corresp="#EDELECLUZE">&#x00C9;tienne Del&#x00E9;cluze</persName> (<date notBefore="1781" notAfter="1863">1781&#x2013;1863</date>), 
                                    subjects that especially attracted <persName corresp="#RPB">Bonington</persName>&#x2014;the coastal scenery of <placeName corresp="#NORMANDY">Normandy</placeName> and the Gothic architecture of <placeName corresp="#ROUEN">Rouen</placeName>&#x2014;seemed 
                                    random and meaningless, low on the scale of the traditional ordering of the Sister Arts. 
                                    Students&#x02BC; understanding should be elevated by historical and religious subjects rather than by landscape&#x2014;much less by the localized, provincial scenes 
                                    that characterized the British school, rather than the timeless classical landscapes of the French tradition. 
                                    Yet, to the alarm of those who defended the tradition of <persName corresp="#AJG">Gros</persName>&#x02BC;s teacher, <persName corresp="#JLD">Jacques&#x2010;Louis David</persName> (<date notBefore="1748" notAfter="1825">1748&#x2013;1825</date>), British&#x2010;influenced picturesque subjects were gaining popularity in <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>. 
                                    French critics also rejected the loose style of the British school, such as the textured brushstrokes of oils by <persName corresp="#CONSTABLEARTIST">John Constable</persName>, 
                                    and the tonal rather than linear definition of architectural drawing by <!-- link to note --><ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="prout_samuel_note.php"><persName corresp="#SP">Samuel Prout</persName></ref> and others of the &#x201C;Monro School&#x201D;.

                                    The seeming disregard for finish by British painters violated the priority that neoclassicism awarded to disegno, 
                                    the conceptual emphasis on design, line, and form

                                    For his contacts in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>, <persName corresp="#RPB">Bonington</persName> relied on engravers, including the <!--link to note--><ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="cooke_family_note.php">Cooke family</ref>, known for their reproduction of work by <persName corresp="#JMWT">J.

                    <p>Ironically, as presented in the respective annuals, the French&#x2010;English affiliations behind <persName corresp="#RPB">Bonington</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s river scenes are turned into rivalries</p>

                        In two plates based on paintings by <persName corresp="#HV">Horace Vernet</persName> (<date notBefore="1789" notAfter="1863">1789&#x2013;1863</date>),

                                    battlefield scenes are combined with genre subjects highlighting the loyalty of domestic animals amid the carnage of war. 
                                    From the standpoint of the critic <persName corresp="#EDELECLUZE">Del&#x00E9;cluze</persName>, <persName corresp="#HV">Vernet</persName>&#x02BC;s Salon pictures, on which engravings like these were based, represented a confusion of genre and history painting, 
                        threatening the conceptual basis of grande peinture (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DOYLEBADMANNERS"><persName corresp="#ADOYLE">Doyle</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#DOYLEBADMANNERS">&#x201C;Bad Manners vs. Good <hi rend="italic">Maniera</hi>&#x201D;</title></ref>, 140). 
                                    Worse, <persName corresp="#HV">Vernet</persName> disseminated a taste for such mixed subjects by embracing contemporary forms of art reproduction, 
                                    such as lithography and aquatint, which challenged the authority given to line engraving by the French Academy

                                    of how the commercialization of art through book illustration, and through such popular spectacles as the diorama, 
                                    threatened a degeneration of the ideology propping up the traditional ordering of the arts.  
                                    Even the volume&#x02BC;s single example approaching Davidian neoclassicism (softened by color and eroticism),

                                which substituted full calf for the printed paper&#x2010;covered boards that was typical of many annuals, including <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT">Forget&#x2010;Me&#x2010;Not</title>. 
                                The calf binding was blind&#x2010;embossed on the full surface of both front and back covers with an arabesque design, 
                                and with a lyre design blocked in gilt in the center of the front cover. As <persName corresp="#EJ">Eleanore Jamieson</persName> explains in

                                the <hi rend="italic">arabesque</hi> pattern was regarded as a revival style hearkening to incunabula, and the style was associated with Continental models 
                                (see also <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php#BINDING">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books: Bindings</ref>).</p>
                            
                            <p>The annuals dueled to be judged by their covers, the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> having set an initial standard with its printed and glazed paper boards, 
                                cloth spine, and slipcase, later replaced by a silk cover

                                Innovation and extravagance&#x2014;or at least the appearance of extravagance&#x2014;in bindings and engraved or lithographed front matter became characteristic of annuals, 
                                which used this immediate source of appeal to compete in a crowded market 
                                (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FAXONLITERARYANNUALS">Faxon, <title type="bibliography" corresp="FAXONLITERARYANNUALS"><hi rend="italic">Literary Annuals</hi></title></ref>, xiv&#x2013;xvi). 
                                Mechanization brought these material appeals within reach of the ordinary consumer; and mass&#x2010;produced fancy bindings in particular 
                                shifted traditional division of labor, since publishers took on the economic burden of bookbinding, which conventionally had been borne by the consumer.</p>
                            
                            <p><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName> also speculates that the annual&#x02BC;s elaborately embossed leather covers suggested the bindings of prayer books and bibles&#x2014;the only other expensively 
                                bound stock that retailers typically offered over the counter (as opposed to cheap temporary bindings, to be replaced by the consumer). 
                                These &#x201C;gospel&#x2010;like bindings&#x201D; may have been meant &#x201C;to convince the reading public of the wholesome value of the literature and engravings within&#x201D; 
                                (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title></ref>, 131, 133&#x2013;34). 
                                A perception of wholesomeness may be borne out by a favorable notice of the <date when="1829">1829</date> volume in 
                                <title type="periodical" corresp="#MIRROROFLITERATURE"><hi rend="italic">The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction</hi></title>, 
                                which focused first on the &#x201C;exterior, which is somewhat novel in taste, . . . by substituting for the usual paper covering 
                                [i.e., like the printed paper boards then covering the <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title>], 
                                an elegantly embossed leather binding. This is altogether an improvement on the original plan, since the slight coverings of silk or paper 
                                is scarcely safe out of the drawing&#x2010;room or boudoir, and some of the contributions to the &#x2018;annuals&#x2019; entitle them to a higher stand&#x201D;

                                By the &#x201C;original plan&#x201D;, the writer refers apparently to the binding used by <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>, 
                                which consisted of glazed paper boards, printed with a decorative and typographic cover, in imitation of the binding used for the <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title>, 
                                but he also refers to the silk covering already being adopted by <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> 
                                (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title></ref>, 133). 
                                The comment apparently gestures at an audience expanded beyond the &#x201C;boudoir&#x201D; to include male readers along with the entire family.</p>

Maroon is the most common color found among surviving copies today, 
                                suggesting that most consumers chose an appearance of respectability; however, a brighter red and possibly a green can still be found as well.</p>

                        Its binding was more sumptuous, and the engraving sharper and more consistent. To mark these improvements, <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> expanded the subtitle, 
                        from <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName>&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="RELFEFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering: A Literary Album</hi></title> to 
                        <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering: A Literary Album and Annual Remembrancer</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A Literary Album, and Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present</hi>.  
                        In <date when="1833">1833</date>, the title changed again, the annual having absorbed another existing publication, <hi rend="italic">Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</hi>, 
                        which had been published in <placeName corresp="#LIVERPOOL">Liverpool</placeName> since <date when="1828">1828</date>. This merger resulted in the title, 
                        <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</hi> (so the title appears on the typeset title page; 
                        for a time, the engraved frontispiece with the earlier title remained in production). 
                        This latest title was in use when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first appeared in the annual, in the issue, 
                        <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath: A Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present for <hi rend="smallcaps">MDCCCXXXV</hi></hi></title>.</p>-->
