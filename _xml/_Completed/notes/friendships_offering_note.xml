                    which appeared in each annual volume until the series' demise.</p>

                        Thus, as <persName corresp="#KDH">Katherine D. Harris</persName> remarks, the title appeared only one year after the very first of the British annuals,

                        Harris transcribes the preface of this debut volume of Friendship's Offering and details the volume's contents, revealing a derivative and miscellaneous assemblage that exposes <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName> 
                        as aspiring only to mimic and capitalize on Ackermann's achievement. He had formed no clear conception of his production, which mixes features of the literary annual with the almanac and the eighteenth&#x2010;century &#x201C;pocket book&#x201D;

                    <p>A low estimation of the beginnings of Friendship's Offering was formed as early as <date when="1858">1858</date>, in a survey of the heyday of the annuals, which declared <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>&#x02BC;s production &#x201C;unpromising&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ANNUALSOFFORMERDAYS"><title type="annual" corresp="#ANNUALSOFFORMERDAYS">&#x201C;The Annuals of Former Days&#x201D;</title></ref>, 496). 
                        To become successful, <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> needed to shed the miscellaneous features derived from its models and to define its niche in the market. 
                        Its shortcomings were acknowledged by the editor, <persName corresp="#TKH">T. K. Hervey</persName> (<date notBefore="1799" notAfter="1859">1799&#x2013;1859</date>), 
                        in his prefatory remarks for the <date when="1826">1826</date> volume: pleading &#x201C;difficulties&#x201D; that arose from the publication having, only &#x201C;very recently, come into the present Editor&#x02BC;s hands" 
                        (<persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName> had in fact edited the title since <date when="1824">1824</date>), he announced "a view to an entire change in . . . [the annual's] character and plan&#x201D;. 
                        He proposed &#x201C;alterations . . . consist[ing] in the removal of all those features which marked it as more peculiarly adapted for one season of the year than another&#x201d;, 
                        with the aim instead of &#x201C;combining, with the increased beauty of its embellishments, a high literary character&#x201d; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName>, ed., <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> [<date when="1826">1826</date>]</ref>, v, vi).</p>
                    <p>With this <date when="1826">1826</date> volume, the hodgepodge of features such as blank calendar pages, informational charts, and sheet music that, according to <persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, had cluttered the first volume, did fall away, 
                        and its "literary character" emerged with contributions by the likes of L.E.L. [Letitia Landon, 1802-38], James Montgomery (1771-1854), and Ruskin's future Camberwell schoolmaster, 
                        the Reverend Thomas Dale (1797-1870). Few engravings "embellish" this volume compared to later robust pictorial standards for the annual, 
                        but the pairings of picture and poem are marked by the Romantic-era transformation of the <hi rend="italic">ut pictura poesis</hi> aesthetic, which Roy Park characterizes as an abandonment of the worn pictorialism of the eighteenth century 
                        in favor of a view of the sister arts as "twin facets of a unified poetic experience" (Park, "'Ut Pictura Poesis': The Nineteenth-Century Aftermath").</p>
                    <p>In the 1826 volume, the pictorial strategy in poems works less as ekphrasis 
                        than as a tribute to shared experience. A poem on a Claude engraving declines the traditional rivalry between poet and painter in the Renaissance paragone ("I feel / No envy of thy noble art, / . . . which, unto outward sense, / Speaks in a language so refined" 
                        (Bernard Barton, "'Am I, Too, in Arcadia?'"). A poem by L.E.L. on the picture Honors Rendered to Raphael on his Deathbed (1806) by the French painter in the Troubadour style, 
                        Pierre Nolasque Bergeret (1782-1863), awards immortality to the sister art: for despite Raphael's "face of death" that is "paler and colder than the marble bust", "how can depart / The soul, yet leave its influence on the heart!" 
                        (L.E.L., "Raphael's Death-Bed"). Two engravings in the volume after Richard Westall (1765-1836), including the frontispiece which illustrates a poem by the editor, are feeble pictures, 
                        but their intrinsic interest probably mattered less than the reputation of this artist, who was known for his numerous illustrations of Romantic-era poets and for his evocative portraits of Byron. 
                        As an 1824 tribute to Westall effused: "Thou saw'st the poet, with a poet's eye, / And hence a poet's mind could well descry, / For thou, to graphic genius not confin'd, / Can'st boast the pow'rs of a poetic mind" 
                        (John Taylor [1757-1832], "Lines on the Portrait of the Late Lord Byron, Painted by Richard Westall, Esq. RA") 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName>, ed., <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> [<date when="1826">1826</date>]</ref>, 47-48, 73-75;

                        <persName corresp="#CK">Knight</persName>, the future publisher for the <orgName corresp="#SDUK">Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge</orgName>, was then struggling to establish himself in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> publishing.

                        It was <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> who would later introduce <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to the fashionable literary world as the author &#x201C;<persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JR">J.R.</persName>&#x201D;</p>

                        Under their custodianship, <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> became a distinctive contribution to this characteristic early&#x2010;Victorian type of publication.
                        Its subtitle expanded to <hi rend="italic">A Literary Album, and Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present</hi>, the annual 
                        improved strikingly in its material appeal. Sales rose, eventually peaking at ten thousand copies per year, assuring the fortunes of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> as a publisher. 
                        (As a comparison, <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName>&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> in some years achieved twenty thousand.

                        This is altogether an improvement on the original plan, since the slight coverings of silk or paper is scarcely safe out of the drawing&#x2010;room or boudoir, 
                        and some of the contributions to the &#x2018;annuals&#x2019; entitle them to a higher stand&#x201D;
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SPIRITOFTHEANNUALS"><title type="periodical" corresp="#MIRROROFLITERATURE">&#x201C;Spirit of &#x2018;The Annuals&#x2019; for 1828&#x201D;</title></ref>, 418). 
                        By the &#x201C;original plan&#x201D;, the writer refers apparently to the binding used by <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>, 
                        which consisted of glazed paper boards, printed with a decorative and typographic cover, in imitation of the binding used for the <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> 
                        (the latter already moving to silk; see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title></ref>, 133).
                        The new binding of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> featured an arabesque design that was blind embossed into the full surface of the dark leather cover, 
                        with a lyre design blocked in gilt in the center of the front cover. As <persName corresp="#EJ">Eleanore Jamieson</persName> remarks in 
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JAMIESONBINDINGSTYLES"><title type="essay"  corresp="#JAMIESONBINDINGSTYLES">&#x201C;The Binding Styles of the Gift Books and Annuals&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        the arabesque pattern was regarded as a revival style hearkening to the early book, and the style was associated with Continental models
                        (p. 11; and see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</ref>).</p>
                    
                    <p>The annuals dueled to be judged by their covers, the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> having set an initial standard with its printed and glazed paper boards, 
                        cloth spine, and slipcase, later replaced by a silk cover 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FORDACKERMANN"><persName corresp="#JFORD">Ford</persName>, <title type="biography" corresp="#FORDACKERMAN"><hi rend="italic">Ackermann</hi></title></ref>, 65).  
                        Innovation and extravagance&#x2014;or at least the appearance of extravagance&#x2014;in bindings and engraved or lithographed front matter became characteristic of annuals, 
                        which used this immediate source of appeal to compete in a crowded market 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FAXONLITERARYANNUALS">Faxon, <title type="bibliography" corresp="FAXONLITERARYANNUALS"><hi rend="italic">Literary Annuals</hi></title></ref>, xiv&#x2013;xvi). 
                        Mechanization brought these material appeals within reach of the ordinary consumer; and mass&#x2010;produced fancy bindings in particular 
                        shifted traditional division of labor, since publishers took on the economic burden of bookbinding, which conventionally had been borne by the consumer.
                        <persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName> also speculates that the annuals&#x02BC; elaborately embossed leather covers echoed the only other expensively 
                        bound stock that retailers typically offered over the counter (as opposed to cheap temporary bindings, to be replaced by the consumer)&#x2014;that is, prayer books and bibles&#x2014;and 
                        therefore these &#x201C;gospel&#x2010;like bindings&#x201D; may have been meant &#x201C;to convince the reading public of the wholesome value of the literature and engravings within&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title></ref>, 131, 133&#x2013;34). 
                        Just so, perhaps the <title type="periodical" corresp="#MIRROROFLITERATURE"><hi rend="italic">Mirror of Literature</hi></title>&#x02BC;s comment that the sturdier cover 
                        of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> matched its more substantial content inside, capable of subsisting beyond the boudoir, 
                        gestured at an audience that included, not just male readers, but the entire family gathered in the parlor.</p>
                    
                    <p>The other notable source of <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="smith_elder_note.php"><orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>&#x02BC;s</ref> success, the quality of illustration, 
                        was the special care of one partner in the young firm, <persName corresp="#AE">Alexander Elder</persName> (<date notBefore="1790" notAfter="1876">1790&#x2013;1876</date>). 
                        According to the biographer of the firm, <persName corresp="#LHUXLEY">Leonard Huxley</persName>, <persName corresp="#AE">Elder</persName> was interested in art, and aspired to produce elegantly illustrated publications 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER"><title type="book" corresp="#HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER"><hi rend="italic">House of Smith Elder</hi></title></ref>, 10). 
                        Illustration was key to the popularity of the annuals, as <persName corresp="#AE">Elder</persName> would have realized from the precedent set by <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName>&#x02BC;s success. 
                        The first issue of <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> had featured a series of emblematic treatments of the twelve months, rendered in copper etching, 
                        along with verses by <persName corresp="#WC">William Combe</persName> (<date notBefore="1742" notAfter="1823">1742&#x2013;1823</date>). 
                        <persName corresp="#WC">Combe</persName> was well known as the author of 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#TOUROFDOCTORSYNTAX"><hi rend="italic">The Tour of Doctor Syntax, in Search of the Picturesque</hi></title> (<date when="1812">1812</date>, <date when="1820">1820</date>, <date when="1821">1821</date>), 
                        a spoof illustrated by <persName corresp="#TR">Thomas Rowlandson</persName> (<date notBefore="1757" notAfter="1827">1757&#x2013;1827</date>). 
                        This illustrated work ranked among the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm&#x02BC;s greatest best&#x2010;sellers 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FORDACKERMANN"><persName corresp="#JFORD">Ford</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#FORDACKERMANN"><hi rend="italic">Ackermann</hi></title></ref>, 52&#x2013;60); 
                        and by employing <persName corresp="#WC">Combe</persName> along with an illustrator on the new publication, <persName corresp="#RAP">Rudolph Ackermann</persName> 
                        was probably striving to maintain this popularity.

                        looked backward, however, to an <date notBefore="1701" notAfter="1800">eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> tradition, rather than forward to new fashions. Copper engraving 
                        was soon to be displaced by more durable steel engraving, which would allow for much larger press runs; and the very inclusion of a monthly calendar hearkened 
                        to the gift annual&#x02BC;s beginnings in the eighteenth&#x2010;century &#x201C;pocket book&#x201D; 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</ref>). 
                        The second volume of <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title>, featured more varied pictorial scenes (albeit with mausoleums predominating), 
                        which were highlighted in the front matter by a list of plates 
                        that stood separately from the literary table of contents. The dual tables of contents&#x2014;emblematic of the growing importance of visual culture in the early Victorian period&#x2014;remained typical of annuals thereafter 
                        (see the facsimiles of <title type="archive" corresp="#HARRISFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> available in

                        this plate would have numbered among the early steel engravings produced by the <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="finden_brothers_note.php">Finden brothers</ref> 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED">Hunnisett, <title type="essay" corresp="#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED"><hi rend="italic">Steel&#x2010;Engraved Book Illustration in England</hi></title></ref>, 84&#x2013;85). 
                        <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName>&#x02BC;s annual had now caught up with the technology of steel engraving for book illustration, 
                        which proved key to the success of all the annuals. As compared with softer copper, which soon lost its edge in repeated impressions, 
                        steel engraving made possible the mass production of images, and helped to satisfy the craving for pervasive, but affordable visual culture by the early&#x2010;Victorian middle class. 
                        These developments coincided with <persName corresp="#AE">Alexander Elder</persName>&#x02BC;s ambitions for <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>.
                    </p>
                    <p><orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> benefited by these early, rapid developments in the annual as a commodity. 
                        Its binding was more sumptuous, and the engraving sharper and more consistent. To mark these improvements, <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> expanded the subtitle, 
                        from <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName>&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="RELFEFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering: A Literary Album</hi></title> to 
                        <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering: A Literary Album and Annual Remembrancer</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A Literary Album, and Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present</hi>.  
                        In <date when="1833">1833</date>, the title changed again, the annual having absorbed another existing publication, <hi rend="italic">Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</hi>, 
                        which had been published in <placeName corresp="#LIVERPOOL">Liverpool</placeName> since <date when="1828">1828</date>. This merger resulted in the title, 
                        <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</hi> (so the title appears on the typeset title page; 
                        for a time, the engraved frontispiece with the earlier title remained in production). 
                        This latest title was in use when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first appeared in the annual, in the issue, 
                        <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath: A Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present for <hi rend="smallcaps">MDCCCXXXV</hi></hi></title>.

                    <p>At the same time, a comparison of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>&#x02BC;s product with the volumes published by the annual&#x02BC;s creator, <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>, 
                        suggests that the new firm attempted to keep the interior uniform with earlier volumes, at least initially. 
                        As remarked about the 1826 volume edited by Hervey for Relfe, the annual was already responsive to the "poetic" sensibility that unified the sister arts during that period. . . </p>

                        We can only guess at gift&#x2010;givers&#x02BC; motives, however. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <persName corresp="#BR">aunt</persName>&#x02BC;s present,

                        who would later become an impressive guest at <placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName> dinners;
