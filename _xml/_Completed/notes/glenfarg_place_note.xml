                    a guidebook devoted specifically to "the famous glen" and its environs, <title type="book" corresp="#JACKGLENFARG"><hi rend="italic">Glenfarg and District Past and Present</hi></title>,

                    In the <date when="1908">1908</date> edition, the glen is credited with having drawn forth the young <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>'s "descriptive powers" 
                    when he passed through the valley "on a winter's day when the rocks were hung with icicles". This allusion to Ruskin's poem is expanded in a later edition of the guidebook (ca. <date calendar="1930">1930s</date>), 
                    which quotes at length from <ref type="apparatus" target="glenfarg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#GLENFARG">&#x201C;Glenfarg&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">and</hi> &#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Papa how pretty those icicles are&#x201D;)</title></ref>.

                    declared the beauties of the glen superior even to the romantic vales of <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName>; and Queen Victoria, 
                    who, in 1842, recorded the "really lovely" views of Glenfarg while on her first journey to Scotland  
                    (<!-- MATCH TAGGING FOR BIBLIOGRAPHY, 4th and 7th eds. respectively--><title type="book" corresp="#JACKGLENFARG">Jack, Glenfarg and District Past and Present</title>, 4th ed., <date when="1808">1908</date>, 12; 7th ed., n.d., 12-13). 
                    These two visits to North Britain by British royalty were significant occasions for Scots, but Victoria's remarks about Glenfarg were not published until 1868 
                    in <!-- title -->Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the Highlands. Leopold's tour in August-September of the year of Ruskin' birth 
                    predated the better-known visit to Scotland by George IV in 1822--the first by a British monarch since Charles II--and the role of master of ceremonies in Edinburgh, 
                    which on the later occasion was entrusted to Walter Scott, was in 1819 bestowed on <!-- persName plus link to note -->James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd, 
                    who would later become acquainted with the Ruskins and an admirer of John's youthful talents. Leopold also enjoyed a public reception in Perth. However, while the prince 
                    was "said to have often expressed himself in glowing terms of admiration" of "the endless diversity of sublime, picturesque, and romantic scenery 
                    which enriches the route by which he approached the Highlands", his compliments on the beauties of Glenfarg in particular 
                    may have been preserved as only a local tradition, supposedly shared with the landlord of the Bein Inn "while the horses were feeding" at this posthouse situated midway in the glen

                    In his poems about Glenfarg, Ruskin mentions "floury mills" and "the water wheel that turns slowly round / Grinding the corn". 
                    In the <date when="1840">1840s</date>, the Farg was still active with four mills for grinding corn, twenty-two thrashing mills, and a sawmill. 
                    As the century advanced, however, profits from this local production were undercut by cheap imported flour;
