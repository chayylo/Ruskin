                    &#x201C;readers on a series of tours&#x201D; of <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>. 
                    Oriented to a traveler coming south from Perth, the glen is described as &#x201C;a romantic little valley embosomed by the <geogName corresp="#OCHILS">Ochils</geogName>&#x201D;; 
                    and the description is focused on the experience of these &#x201C;dwarfish" hills "when compared with the lofty <geogName corresp="#GRAMPIANS">Grampians</geogName>" to the north. 
                    More domestic and accessible, the Ochils "present a smooth surface, and are clothed to their summits with the deepest verdure, possessing also a pastoral serenity and softness, 
                    which give a new and pleasurable tone to the mind of the tourist, who returns from contemplating the magnificence of <geogName corresp="#SCOTTISHHIGHLANDS">Highland</geogName> scenery&#x201D;

                <p>In descriptions of approaching the glen from the south, the direction traveled by the Ruskins when first encountering Glenfarg during a tour, 
                    the glen itself takes on a greater share of the sublime, regarded by a traveler writing in the late nineteenth century as "certainly the finest portion of the journey, 
                    and perhaps the only bit of grand scenery that is to be met with on the road between Queensferry and the Bridge of Earn". 
                    In this writer's account of the parishes immediately north of the Firth of Forth, the landscape traversed by the 
                    "Great North Road between Kinross and Damhead [i.e., the village of Glenfarg], 
                    after leaving Milnathort and losing sight of Loch Leven", was "of a very dreary character,
                    being bleak and solitary, without any of those grander features which often impart an interest to a wild and unfrequented country" 
                    (Beveridge, Between the Ochils and Forth, 95, 94). 
                    By the early twentieth century, in a guidebook devoted specifically to Glenfarg and its environs, 
                    the valley was represented as "the famous glen" admired by travelers coming north, 
                    from Prince Leopold to Queen Victoria to the young Ruskin. 
                    The latter is mentioned in an earlier edition (1908) of the guidebook as being inspired to "descriptive powers" 
                    by passing through Glenfarg "on a winter's day when the rocks were hung with icicles", 
                    while a later edition (ca. 1930s) expands on this comment by quoting at length from 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="glenfarg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#GLENFARG">&#x201C;Glenfarg&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">and</hi> &#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Papa how pretty those icicles are&#x201D;)</title></ref> 
                    (Jack, Glenfarg and District Past an Present, 4th ed., 1808, 12; 7th ed., n.d., 12-13).</p>
                
                <p>In Glenfarg and District Past an Present, the glen is described as "commenc[ing] about one mile [north] from the village"--the village 
                    known as Damhead "in olden times", but changed to Glenfarg in 1890 with the advent of a rail line, 
                    and situated five miles north of Milnathort, six and a half miles south of the Bridge of Earn, and ten miles south of Perth--the 
                    Ruskins' destination when visiting John James's sister, <!-- note ref -->Jessie Richardson, 
                    and her family prior to Jessie's death in 1828. The glen "extends three miles downward till it opens out into Strathearn" on its north end 
                    (i.e., the valley of the Earn, which flows eastward from Loch Earn to the river Tay) 
                    (Jack, Glenfarg and District Past an Present, 7th ed., n.d., 12).</p>
                
                <p>The glen follows the <geogName corresp="#FARG">River Farg (or Farg Water)</geogName>, which turns north-northeast in the village, 
                    and which marks the meeting of three county boundaries--of Perth, Fife, and Kinross. 
                    In an account of the parish, <placeName corresp="#ARNGASK">Arngask</placeName>, prepared for 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#STATISTICALACCOUNTSCOTLAND"><title type="reference" corresp="#STATISTICALACCOUNTSCOTLAND"><hi rend="italic">The New Statistical Account of Scotland</hi></title></ref> 
                    (<date when="1845">1845</date>), the <geogName corresp="#FARG">Farg</geogName> is described as &#x201C;a small stream which rises near the western extremity of the parish, 
                    and, for upwards of a mile, separates it from that of <placeName corresp="#FORGANDENNY">Forgandenny</placeName>. It then flows through the parish, 
                    separating, till it reaches <placeName corresp="#DAMHEAD">Damhead</placeName>, the <placeName corresp="#KINROSS-SHIRE">county of Kinross</placeName> from that of <placeName corresp="#PERTHSHIRE">Perth</placeName>. 
                    Then it begins to separate the <placeName corresp="#PERTHSHIRE">county of Perth</placeName> from that of <placeName corresp="#FIFE">Fife</placeName>, and continues to form the boundary between these counties 
                    till it arrives at the point where it leaves the parish, about the middle of the romantic and beautifully wooded glen [i.e., <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName>] to which it communicates its name, 
                    and which travellers so much admire&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BURTSTATISTICALACCOUNT"><persName corresp="#ABURT">Burt</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#BURTSTATISTICALACCOUNT">&#x201C;Parish of Arngask&#x201D;</title>, in <title type="reference" corresp="#STATISTICALACCOUNTSCOTLAND"><hi rend="italic">The New Statistical Account of Scotland</hi></title></ref>, 10:883). 
                    (In the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#STATISTICALACCOUNTSCOTLAND"><title type="reference" corresp="#STATISTICALACCOUNTSCOTLAND"><hi rend="italic">New Statistical Account of Scotland</hi></title></ref>, 
                    <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName> is most clearly identified on the northwest corner of the map of <placeName corresp="#FIFE">Fife</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#KINROSS-SHIRE">Kinross</placeName> counties 
                    that is published with volume 9 of the series.)</p>
                
                <p>The condition of the road that the Ruskins would have followed along the Farg in the 1820s is unclear, 
                    for although "the Great North [Road] . . . from Edinburgh to Aberdeen was engineered in 1808-1810, 
                    . . . the part south to Milnathort [near Loch Leven, just below Glenfarg] was not completed till 1832". 
                    In any case, the route through the village formed a section of "the old coaching-road from Queensferry to Perth. . . . 
                    The coaches came from Kinross via Milnathort, Middleton, Newhill and Langside". 
                    In the village, horses were changed at the Punch Bowl Inn 
                    (Jack, Glenfarg and District Past and Present, 7th ed., n.d., 12). 
                    Entering the glen, the Great North road "skirt[ed] the Farg", 
                    "reveal[ing] at every turn a varied succession of moss-mottled rocks and bosky banks, 
                    screened at pleasing intervals with covers of larch and fir" 
                    (Beveridge, Between the Ochils and Forth, 95; 
                    Jack, Glenfarg and District Past an Present, 7th ed., n.d., 12).
                    In 1819, Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, on a tour of North Britain following the death of his spouse, Princess Charlotte, 
                    pronounced the beauties of the glen superior even to the romantic vales of Germany. 
                    He was stopping at the Bein Inn, halfway down the glen, which "in the old coaching days" presented 
                    "the third and last stage on the road from Queensferry to Perth", 
                    although "the building which then formed the inn" was said to stand "a little farther down the hill than the present caravanserai" of 1888
                    (Jack, Glenfarg and District Past and Present, 7th ed., n.d., 12; 
                    Beveridge, Between the Ochils and Forth, 95). 
                    Beyond the glen, the road led to a pass over the Ochils known as the Wicks of Baiglie, 
                    connected with a prospect of Perth described in Walter Scott's The Fair Maid of Perth, 
                    although the situation of this view and of the area named the Wicks became matters of speculation 
                    (see Beveridge, Between the Ochils and Forth, 96-101; 
                    Jack, Glenfarg and District Past an Present, 7th ed., n.d., 22-24).</p>
                
                <p>While the early twentieth-century Glenfarg guidebook made a bid for the village as "developing into a healthy, attractive summer resort", 
                    supported by rail service and other new amenities that would have appeared foreign to the experience of Ruskin's youth 
                    (Jack, Glenfarg and District Past an Present [4th ed., 1908], 4), 
                    Ruskin's boyhood poems perhaps reflect the guidebook's claim that "the air" of Glenfarg "is generally clear and dry, 
                    when Strathearn and Perth are enveloped in mist and dampness", given that Ruskin traces the "dreary way" from Perth to the Earn 
                    in the poem <!-- apparatus and title to come -->"To Scotland", 
                    whereas he directs the spectator from the "grassy hills" to the clear and "starry" sky in 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#GLENOFGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; [&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;]</title></ref>, 
                    and from the "icicles . . . so near . . . so far" to the "trees . . . waving upon the rocks side" to the "mountains at a distance seen" in 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="glenfarg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#GLENFARG">&#x201C;Glenfarg&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">and</hi> &#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; [&#x201C;Papa how pretty those icicles are&#x201D;]</title></ref>. 
                    As the guide book explains: "Being surrounded by hills", the village "has thus the double advantage of having a dry, 
                    wholesome, pure air, such as cannnot be found in low-lying places, and of being well sheltered from violent winds, 
                    or cold inclement blasts" (Jack, Glenfarg and District Past an Present [7th ed., n.d.], 3).</p>
                
                <p>In both of the Glenfarg poems, Ruskin mentions the "floury mills" with "the water wheel that turns slowly round / Grinding the corn". 
                    In the 1840s, the Farn was still active with four mills for grinding corn, twenty-two thrashing mills, and a sawmill. 
                    According to the 1908 edition of the Glenfarg guidebook, profits from this local production had been undercut by cheap imported flour,
                    and the meal and flour mills long closed, their "decaying walls" along the Farg 
                    "now silent as the grave, save when the winds sigh eerily" through them. If, according to the 1908 edition, 
                    "old people . . . in our parish" may have remembered the mills, by the 1930s edition "no one now lives who was familiar with these meal mills in our parish" 
                    (Jack, Glenfarg and District Past an Present, 7th ed., n.d., 8-9; 4th ed., 1908, 9-10).<!-- <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName> was a place one visited, not when taking a day excursion from <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>, but when departing <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> altogether&#x2014;proceeding southward, on the way to
