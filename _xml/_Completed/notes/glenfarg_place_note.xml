                <p>The glen is a deep wooded valley traversed by the <geogName corresp="#FARG">River Farg (or Farg Water)</geogName>. 
                    As described in an early twentieth-century guidebook, the glen &#x201C;commences about one mile [north] from the village&#x201D;, which was known &#x201C;in olden times&#x201D;&#x2014;the time of Ruskin&#x02BC;s youth&#x2014;as <placeName corresp="#DAMHEAD">Damhead</placeName>

                    At this time, the village was described as situated five miles north of <placeName corresp="#MILNATHORT">Milnathort</placeName> (a village on the north bank of <geogName corresp="#LOCHLEVEN">Loch Leven</geogName>), six and a half miles south of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#EARNBRG">Bridge of Earn</placeName> (crossing the <geogName corresp="#EARN">River Earn</geogName>),

                <p>The <geogName corresp="#FARG">River Farg</geogName>, which descends from the <geogName corresp="#OCHILS">Ochils</geogName> and turns north&#x2010;northeast at the <placeName corresp="#GLENFARGVILLAGE">village of Glenfarg</placeName> and thence into the glen, 
                    marks the meeting of three county boundaries&#x2014;the counties of <placeName corresp="#PERTHSHIRE">Perth</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#FIFESHIRE">Fife</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#KINROSS-SHIRE">Kinross</placeName>. 
                    In an account of the parish <placeName corresp="#ARNGASK-PARISH">Arngask</placeName>, prepared for 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#STATISTICALACCOUNTSCOTLAND"><title type="book" corresp="#STATISTICALACCOUNTSCOTLAND"><hi rend="italic">The New Statistical Account of Scotland</hi></title></ref> 
                    (<date when="1845">1845</date>), the <geogName corresp="#FARG">Farg</geogName> is described as &#x201C;a small stream which rises near the western extremity of the parish, 
                    and, for upwards of a mile, separates it from that of <placeName corresp="#FORGANDENNY-PARISH">Forgandenny</placeName>. It then flows through the parish, 
                    separating, till it reaches <placeName corresp="#DAMHEAD">Damhead</placeName>, the <placeName corresp="#KINROSS-SHIRE">county of Kinross</placeName> from that of <placeName corresp="#PERTHSHIRE">Perth</placeName>. 
                    Then it begins to separate the <placeName corresp="#PERTHSHIRE">county of Perth</placeName> from that of <placeName corresp="#FIFE">Fife</placeName>, and continues to form the boundary between these counties 
                    till it arrives at the point where it leaves the parish, about the middle of the romantic and beautifully wooded glen [i.e., <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName>] to which it communicates its name, 
                    and which travellers so much admire&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BURTSTATISTICALACCOUNT"><persName corresp="#ABURT">Burt</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#BURTSTATISTICALACCOUNT">&#x201C;Parish of Arngask&#x201D;</title>, in <title type="reference" corresp="#STATISTICALACCOUNTSCOTLAND"><hi rend="italic">The New Statistical Account of Scotland</hi></title></ref>, 10:883). 
                    Through the glen, the river &#x0201C;extends three miles downward till it opens out into <geogName corresp="#STRATHEARN">Strathearn</geogName>&#x0201D; on its north end&#x2014;that is, 
                    the valley of the <geogName corresp="#EARN">River Earn</geogName>, which flows eastward from <placeName corresp="#LOCHEARN">Loch Earn</placeName> to <geogName corresp="#TAYRIV">River Tay</geogName>

                    (In the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#STATISTICALACCOUNTSCOTLAND"><title type="reference" corresp="#STATISTICALACCOUNTSCOTLAND"><hi rend="italic">New Statistical Account of Scotland</hi></title></ref>, 
                    <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName> is most clearly identified on the northwest corner of the map of <placeName corresp="#FIFESHIRE">Fife</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#KINROSS-SHIRE">Kinross</placeName> counties 
                    that is published with volume 9 of the series. A detailed map is also available in 
                    <persName corresp="#JWJ">Jack</persName>, <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JACKGLENFARG7ED"><hi rend="italic"><title type="book" corresp="#JACKGLENFARG7ED">Glenfarg and District Past and Present</title></hi></ref>.) </p>
                
                <p>The growing fame of the picturesque attraction can be traced in successive guidebooks. 
                    In the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> composed his poems, 
                    <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName> rated a brief mention in one of the &#x201C;short, portable&#x201D; guidebooks that <persName corresp="#KHGRENIER">Kathleen Grenier</persName> says appeared in this decade to lead 
                    &#x201C;readers on a series of tours&#x201D; through <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#TOURISMANDIDENTITY"><title type="book" corresp="#TOURISMANDIDENTITY"><hi rend="italic">Tourism and Identity in Scotland</hi></title></ref>, 66). 
                    In <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTISHTOURIST"><hi rend="italic">The Scottish Tourist</hi></title> (<date when="1825">1825</date>), the traveler coming south from <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> 
                    is alerted to the glen as &#x201C;a romantic little valley embosomed by the <geogName corresp="#OCHILS">Ochils</geogName>.&#x201D; These hills 
                    are characterized as &#x201C;dwarfish when compared with the lofty <geogName corresp="#GRAMPIANS">Grampians</geogName>" to the north; 
                    yet, because the <placeName corresp="#OCHILS">Ochils</placeName> &#x201C;present a smooth surface, and are clothed to their summits with the deepest verdure, possessing also a pastoral serenity and softness,&#x201D; 
                    the scene imparts &#x201C;a new and pleasurable tone to the mind of the tourist, who returns from contemplating the magnificence of <geogName corresp="#SCOTTISHHIGHLANDS">Highland</geogName> scenery&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SCOTTISHTOURIST"><title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTISHTOURIST"><hi rend="italic">The Scottish Tourist, and Itinerary</hi></title> [3d ed., <date when="1830">1830</date>]</ref>, 125).</p>
                
                <p>In later accounts, rather than being regarded as easing the spectator down from the grandeur of the <geogName corresp="#SCOTTISHHIGHLANDS">Highlands</geogName>, 
                    the glen takes on its own share of the sublime. When approached from the south, riding north from the <geogName corresp="#FIRTHOFFORTH">Firth of Forth</geogName>&#x2014;the direction 
                    traveled by the Ruskins when first encountering <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName> during a tour&#x2014;the glen presented 
                    &#x201C;certainly the finest portion of the journey, and perhaps the only bit of grand scenery that is to be met with on the road 
                    between <placeName corresp="#QUEENSFERRY">Queensferry</placeName> and the <placeName type="building" corresp="#EARNBRG">Bridge of Earn</placeName>&#x201D;, 
                    according to a travel writer in the <date notBefore="1880" notAfter="1889">1880s</date>. Prior to reaching the glen, in this writer's experience, the landscape traversed by the 
                    &#x201C;<placeName type="building" corresp="#GNR">Great North Road</placeName> between <placeName corresp="#KINROSS">Kinross</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#DAMHEAD">Damhead</placeName> [i.e., the village of <geogName corresp="#GLENFARGVILLAGE">Glenfarg</geogName>], 
                    after leaving <placeName corresp="#MILNATHORT">Milnathort</placeName> and losing sight of <geogName corresp="#LOCHLEVEN">Loch Leven</geogName>&#x201D;, was &#x201C;of a very dreary character,
                    being bleak and solitary, without any of those grander features which often impart an interest to a wild and unfrequented country&#x201D;. 
                    Beyond <placeName corresp="#DAMHEAD">Damhead</placeName>, however, &#x201C;the <placeName type="building" corresp="#GNR">Great North Road</placeName> skirts the <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Farg</geogName>&#x201D;, the road &#x201C;descend[ing alongside the river] between the wood&#x2010;clad sides of the magnificent glen&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BEVERIDGEOCHILSANDFORTH"><title type="book" corresp="#BEVERIDGEOCHILSANDFORTH"><hi rend="italic">Beveridge, Between the Ochils and Forth</hi></title></ref>, 95, 94).</p>

                <p>By the early twentieth century, when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poems about <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName> had become available in print, 
                    a guidebook devoted specifically to &#x201C;the famous glen&#x201D; and its environs, <title type="book" corresp="#JACKGLENFARG"><hi rend="italic">Glenfarg and District Past and Present</hi></title>, 
                    touted how the route had been highlighted by northbound celebrity travelers, ranging from the young <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                    to <persName corresp="#KL1">Prince Leopold of Saxe&#x2010;Coburg, the future king of <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName></persName> to <persName corresp="#QVE">Queen Victoria</persName>. 
                    In the <date when="1908">1908</date> edition of the guidebook, the glen is credited with having drawn forth the young <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;descriptive powers&#x201D; 
                    when he passed through the valley &#x201C;on a winter&#x02BC;s day when the rocks were hung with icicles&#x201D;. This allusion to Ruskin&#x02BC;s poem is expanded in a later edition of the guidebook (ca. <date calendar="1930">1930s</date>), 
                    quoting at length from <ref type="apparatus" target="glenfarg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#GLENFARG">&#x201C;Glenfarg&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">and</hi> &#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Papa how pretty those icicles are&#x201D;)</title></ref>. 
                    For royal testimonials to the beauty of the glen, the guidebook quotes <persName corresp="#KL1">Leopold of Saxe&#x2010;Coburg</persName>, who, 
                    in <date when="1819">1819</date> while on a tour of <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> following the death of his spouse, <persName corresp="#CAUGUSTA">Princess Charlotte</persName>, 
                    declared the beauties of the glen superior even to the romantic vales of <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName>; and <persName corresp="#QVE">Queen Victoria</persName> is quoted, 
                    remarking on the &#x201C;really lovely&#x201D; views of <placeName corresp="#GLENFARGVILLAGE">Glenfarg</placeName> while on her first journey to <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>, in <date when="1842">1842</date>  
                    (<persName corresp="#JWJ">Jack</persName>, <hi rend="italic"><title type="book" corresp="#JACKGLENFARG">Glenfarg and District Past and Present</title></hi>, <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JACKGLENFARG4ED">4th ed.</ref>, <date when="1808">1908</date>, 12; <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JACKGLENFARG7ED">7th ed.</ref>, n.d., 12-13).</p>
                
                <p>
                    These two visits to North Britain by British royalty were significant occasions for Scots, but Victoria&#x02BC;s remarks about Glenfarg were not published until 1868 
                    in <hi rend="italoc"><title type="book" corresp="#LEAVESJOURNALOFLIFEINHIGHLANDS">Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the Highlands</title></hi>. Leopold&#x02BC;s tour in August&#x2013;September of the year of Ruskin&#x02BC;s birth 
                    predated the better&#x2010;known visit to Scotland by George IV in <date when="1822">1822</date>&#x2014;the first by a British monarch since Charles II&#x2014;and the role of master of ceremonies in Edinburgh, 
                    which on the later occasion was entrusted to Walter Scott, was in 1819 bestowed on <!-- link to note --><!-- Not sure how to link a note --> <persName corresp="JH">James Hogg</persName>, the Ettrick Shepherd, 
                    who would later become acquainted with the Ruskins and an admirer of John&#x02BC;s youthful talents. Leopold also enjoyed a public reception in Perth. However, while the prince 
                    was &#x201C;said to have often expressed himself in glowing terms of admiration&#x201D; of &#x201C;the endless diversity of sublime, picturesque, and romantic scenery 
                    which enriches the route by which he approached the Highlands&#x201D;, his compliments on the beauties of Glenfarg in particular

                    Despite these services, the condition of the road that the Ruskins would have followed along the <geogName corresp="#FARG">Farg</geogName> in the <date calendar="1820">1820s</date> is unclear, 
                    for although &#x201C;the <placeName corresp="#GNR">Great North [Road]</placeName> . . . from <placeName corresp="#EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#ABERDEEN">Aberdeen</placeName> was engineered in <date notBefore="1808" notAfter="1810">1808-1810</date>, 
                    . . . the part south to <placeName corresp="#MILNATHORT">Milnathort</placeName> [near <geogName corresp="#LOCHLEVEN">Loch Leven</geogName>, just below <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName>] was not completed till <date when="1832">1832</date>&#x201D;. 
                    In any case, the route through the village formed a section of &#x201C;the old coaching&#x2010;ro andad from <placeName corresp="#QUEENSFERRY">Queensferry</placeName> to <placeName corresp="PERTH">Perth</placeName>. . . . 
                    Beyond the glen, the road led to a pass over the <geogName corresp="#OCHILS">Ochils</geogName> known as the <placeName corresp="#WICKSOBAIGLIE">Wicks of Baiglie</placeName>, which was 
                    associated with a prospect of <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> as described in <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTFAIRMAIDOFPERTH">The Fair Maid of Perth</title>,

                <p>In <ref type="apparatus" target="glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#GLENOFGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; [&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;]</title></ref>, 
                    In his poems about Glenfarg, Ruskin mentions &#x201C;floury mills&#x201D; and &#x201C;the water wheel that turns slowly round / Grinding the corn&#x201D;. 
                    In the <date when="1840">1840s</date>, the Farg was still active with four mills for grinding corn, twenty&#x2010;two thrashing mills, and a sawmill. 
                    As the century advanced, however, profits from this local production were undercut by cheap imported flour; 
                    and the meal and flour mills long are described in the <date when="1908">1908</date> edition of the <geogName corresp="GLENFLARG">Glenfarg</geogName> guidebook as long closed, 
                    their &#x201C;decaying walls&#x201D; along the Farg &#x201C;now silent as the grave, save when the winds sigh eerily&#x201D; through them. If the <date when="1908">1908</date> edition could still point to 
                    &#x201C;old people . . . in our parish&#x201D; who remembered the mills, the <date when="1930">1930s</date> edition concluded that &#x201C;no one now lives who was familiar with these meal mills in our parish&#x201D; 
                    (<title type="book" corresp="#JACKGLENFARG">Jack, Glenfarg and District Past an Present</title>, 7th ed., n.d., 8&#x2010;9; 4th ed., <date when="1908">1908</date>, 9&#x2010;10).</p>
                
                <p>In response to these changes, which Ruskin would doubtless have regretted, 
                    the early twentieth&#x2010;century guidebooks to <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName> were designed to vest the future economy of the region in 
                    &#x201C;developing into a healthy, attractive summer resort&#x201D;, supported by rail service and other new amenities 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JACKGLENFARG4ED"> <persName corresp="#JWJ">Jack</persName>, <hi rend="italic"><title type="book" corresp="#JACKGLENFARG4ED">Glenfarg and District Past and Present</title></hi></ref> [4th ed., 1908], 4). 
                    Dismal as he would have considered that prospect, Ruskin&#x02BC;s early poems do at least confirm the guidebooks&#x02BC; claim that &#x201C;the air&#x201D; of <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName> &#x201C;is generally clear and dry, 
                    when <geogName corresp="#STRATHEARN">Strathearn</geogName> and <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> are enveloped in mist and dampness&#x201D;. 
                    In <!-- apparatus and title to come -->&#x201C;To Scotland&#x201D;, he traces the &#x201C;dreary way&#x201D; from <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> to the <placeName corresp="#LOCHEARN">Earn</placeName>, 
                    whereas he directs the spectator from the &#x201C;grassy hills&#x201D; to the clear and &#x201C;starry&#x201D; sky in
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#GLENOFGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; [&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;]</title></ref>, 
                    and from the &#x201C;icicles . . . so near . . . so far&#x201D; to the &#x201C;trees . . . waving upon the rocks side&#x201D; to the &#x201C;mountains at a distance seen&#x201D; in

                    As the later guide book explains: &#x201C;Being surrounded by hills&#x201D;, the village &#x201C;has thus the double advantage of having a dry, 
                    wholesome, pure air, such as cannnot be found in low-lying places, and of being well sheltered from violent winds, 
                    or cold inclement blasts&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JACKGLENFARG7ED"> <persName corresp="#JWJ">Jack</persName>, <hi rend="italic"><title type="book" corresp="#JACKGLENFARG7ED">Glenfarg and District Past and Present</title></hi></ref> [7th ed., n.d.], 3).</p>
