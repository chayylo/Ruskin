                <p>A glen in <placeName corresp="#PERTHSHIRE">Perthshire</placeName>, which Ruskin describes in

                <p><geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName> is mentioned briefly in a guidebook first published near the time of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poems--one among &#x201C;short, portable books&#x201D; that emerged in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> to lead 
                    &#x201C;readers on a series of tours&#x201D; of <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>. 
                    Oriented to a traveler coming south from Perth, the glen is described as &#x201C;a romantic little valley embosomed by the <geogName corresp="#OCHILS">Ochils</geogName>&#x201D;; 
                    and the description is focused on the experience of these &#x201C;dwarfish" hills "when compared with the lofty <geogName corresp="#GRAMPIANS">Grampians</geogName>" to the north. 
                    More domestic and accessible, the Ochils "present a smooth surface, and are clothed to their summits with the deepest verdure, possessing also a pastoral serenity and softness, 
                    which give a new and pleasurable tone to the mind of the tourist, who returns from contemplating the magnificence of <geogName corresp="#SCOTTISHHIGHLANDS">Highland</geogName> scenery&#x201D;

                <p>In descriptions of approaching the glen from the south, the direction traveled by the Ruskins when first encountering <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName> during a tour, 
                    the glen itself takes on a greater share of the sublime, regarded by a traveler writing in the late nineteenth century as "certainly the finest portion of the journey, 
                    and perhaps the only bit of grand scenery that is to be met with on the road between <placeName corresp="#QUEENSFERRY">Queensferry</placeName> and the <placeName corresp="#EARNBRG">Bridge of Earn"</placeName>. 
                    In this writer's account of the parishes immediately north of the <geogName corresp="#FIRTHOFFORTH">Firth of Forth</geogName>, the landscape traversed by the 
                    "<placeName corresp="#GNR">Great North Road</placeName> between <placeName corresp="#KINROSS">Kinross</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#DAMHEAD">Damhead</placeName> [i.e., the village of <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName>], 
                    after leaving <placeName corresp="#MILNATHORT">Milnathort</placeName> and losing sight of <geogName corresp="#LOCHLEVEN">Loch Leven</geogName>", was "of a very dreary character,
                    being bleak and solitary, without any of those grander features which often impart an interest to a wild and unfrequented country" 
                    ( <title type="book" corresp="#BEVERIDGEOCHILSANDFORTH">Beveridge, Between the Ochils and Forth</title>, 95, 94). 
                    By the early twentieth century, in a guidebook devoted specifically to <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName> and its environs, 
                    the valley was represented as "the famous glen" admired by travelers coming north, 
                    from <persName corresp="#PLDA">Prince Leopold</persName> to <persName corresp="#QVE">Queen Victoria</persName> to the young Ruskin. 
                    The latter is mentioned in an earlier edition (<date when="1908">1908</date>) of the guidebook as being inspired to "descriptive powers" 
                    by passing through <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName> "on a winter's day when the rocks were hung with icicles", 
                    while a later edition (ca. <date calendar="1930">1930s</date>) expands on this comment by quoting at length from

                <p>In (<title type="book" corresp="#JACKGLENFARG">Glenfarg and District Past an Present</title>, the glen is described as "commenc[ing] about one mile [north] from the village"--the village 
                    known as <placeName corresp="#DAMHEAD">Damhead</placeName> "in olden times", but changed to <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName> in <date when="1890">1890</date> with the advent of a rail line, 
                    and situated five miles north of <placeName corresp="#MILNATHORT">Milnathort</placeName>, six and a half miles south of the <placeName corresp="#EARNBRG">Bridge of Earn"</placeName>, and ten miles south of <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>--the 
                    Ruskins' destination when visiting <persName corresp="#JJR">John James's</persName> sister, <!-- note ref --><persName corresp="#JRP">Jessie Richardson</persName>, 
                    and her family prior to <date notBefore="1827-01-01" notAfter="1827-03-20">Jessie's death</date> in <date when="1828">1828</date>. The glen "extends three miles downward till it opens out into <geogName corresp="#STRATHEARN">Strathearn</geogName>" on its north end 
                    (i.e., the valley of the <geogName corresp="#EARN">Earn</geogName>, which flows eastward from <placeName corresp="#LOCHEARN">Loch Earn</placeName> to the river <geogName corresp="#TAYRIV">Tay</geogName>) 
                    (<title type="book" corresp="#JACKGLENFARG">Jack, Glenfarg and District Past an Present</title>, 7th ed., n.d., 12).</p>
                
                <p>The glen follows the <geogName corresp="#FARG">River Farg (or Farg Water)</geogName>, which turns north-northeast in the village, 
                    and which marks the meeting of three county boundaries--of <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#FIFE">Fife</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#KINROSS">Kinross</placeName>. 
                    In an account of the parish, <placeName corresp="#ARNGASK">Arngask</placeName>, prepared for

                    (<date when="1845">1845</date>), the <geogName corresp="#FARG">Farg</geogName> is described as &#x201C;a small stream which rises near the western extremity of the parish, 
                    and, for upwards of a mile, separates it from that of <placeName corresp="#FORGANDENNY">Forgandenny</placeName>. It then flows through the parish, 
                    separating, till it reaches <placeName corresp="#DAMHEAD">Damhead</placeName>, the <placeName corresp="#KINROSS-SHIRE">county of Kinross</placeName> from that of <placeName corresp="#PERTHSHIRE">Perth</placeName>. 
                    Then it begins to separate the <placeName corresp="#PERTHSHIRE">county of Perth</placeName> from that of <placeName corresp="#FIFE">Fife</placeName>, and continues to form the boundary between these counties 
                    till it arrives at the point where it leaves the parish, about the middle of the romantic and beautifully wooded glen [i.e., <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName>] to which it communicates its name, 
                    and which travellers so much admire&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BURTSTATISTICALACCOUNT"><persName corresp="#ABURT">Burt</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#BURTSTATISTICALACCOUNT">&#x201C;Parish of Arngask&#x201D;</title>, in <title type="reference" corresp="#STATISTICALACCOUNTSCOTLAND"><hi rend="italic">The New Statistical Account of Scotland</hi></title></ref>, 10:883).

                    <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName> is most clearly identified on the northwest corner of the map of <placeName corresp="#FIFE">Fife</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#KINROSS-SHIRE">Kinross</placeName> counties 
                    that is published with volume 9 of the series.)</p>
                
                <p>The condition of the road that the Ruskins would have followed along the <geogName corresp="#FARG">Farg</geogName> in the <date calendar="1820">1820s</date> is unclear, 
                    for although "the <placeName corresp="#GNR">Great North [Road]</placeName> . . . from <placeName corresp="#EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#ABERDEEN">Aberdeen</placeName> was engineered in <date notBefore="1808" notAfter="1810">1808-1810</date>, 
                    . . . the part south to <placeName corresp="#MILNATHORT">Milnathort</placeName> [near <geogName corresp="#LOCHLEVEN">Loch Leven</geogName>, just below <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName>] was not completed till <date when="1832">1832</date>". 
                    In any case, the route through the village formed a section of "the old coaching-road from <placeName corresp="#QUEENSFERRY">Queensferry</placeName> to <placeName corresp="PERTH">Perth</placeName>. . . . 
                    The coaches came from <placeName corresp="#KINROSS">Kinross</placeName> via <placeName corresp="#MILNATHORT">Milnathort</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#MIDDLETON">Middleton</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#NEWHILL">Newhill</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#LANGSIDE">Langside</placeName>". 
                    In the village, horses were changed at the <placeName type="building" corresp="#PUNCHBOWLINN">Punch Bowl Inn </placeName>
                    (<title type="book" corresp="#JACKGLENFARG">Jack, Glenfarg and District Past an Present</title>, 7th ed., n.d., 12). 
                    Entering the glen, the <placeName corresp="#GNR">Great North road</placeName> "skirt[ed] the <geogName corresp="#FARG">Farg</geogName>", 
                    "reveal[ing] at every turn a varied succession of moss-mottled rocks and bosky banks, 
                    screened at pleasing intervals with covers of larch and fir" 
                    (<title type="book" corresp="#BEVERIDGEOCHILSANDFORTH">Beveridge, Between the Ochils and Forth</title>, 95;

                    In <date when="1819">1819</date>, <persName corresp="#LGCF">Leopold</persName> of Saxe-Coburg, on a tour of <placeName corresp="#NBRITAIN">North Britain</placeName> following the death of his spouse, <persName corresp="#CAUGUSTA">Princess Charlotte</persName>, 
                    pronounced the beauties of the glen superior even to the romantic vales of <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName>. 
                    He was stopping at the <placeName corresp="#BEININN">Bein Inn</placeName>, halfway down the glen, which "in the old coaching days" presented 
                    "the third and last stage on the road from <placeName corresp="#QUEENSFERRY">Queensferry</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>", 
                    although "the building which then formed the inn" was said to stand "a little farther down the hill than the present caravanserai" of <date when="1888">1888</date>
                    (<title type="book" corresp="#JACKGLENFARG">Jack, Glenfarg and District Past an Present</title>, 7th ed., n.d., 12; 
                    <title type="book" corresp="#BEVERIDGEOCHILSANDFORTH">Beveridge, Between the Ochils and Forth</title>, 95). 
                    Beyond the glen, the road led to a pass over the <geogName corresp="#OCHILS">Ochils</geogName> known as the <placeName corresp="#WICKSOBAIGLIE">Wicks of Baiglie</placeName>, 
                    connected with a prospect of <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> described in <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott's</persName> <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTFAIRMAIDOFPERTH">The Fair Maid of Perth</title>, 
                    although the situation of this view and of the area named the <placeName corresp="#WICKSOBAIGLIE">Wicks</placeName> became matters of speculation 
                    (see <title type="book" corresp="#BEVERIDGEOCHILSANDFORTH">Beveridge, Between the Ochils and Forth</title>, 96-101; 
                    <title type="book" corresp="#JACKGLENFARG">Jack, Glenfarg and District Past an Present</title>, 7th ed., n.d., 22-24).</p>
                
                <p>While the early twentieth-century <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName> guidebook made a bid for the village as "developing into a healthy, attractive summer resort", 
                    supported by rail service and other new amenities that would have appeared foreign to the experience of Ruskin's youth 
                    (<title type="book" corresp="#JACKGLENFARG">Jack, Glenfarg and District Past an Present</title> [4th ed., 1908], 4), 
                    Ruskin's boyhood poems perhaps reflect the guidebook's claim that "the air" of <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName> "is generally clear and dry, 
                    when <geogName corresp="#STRATHEARN">Strathearn</geogName> and <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> are enveloped in mist and dampness", given that Ruskin traces the "dreary way" from <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> to the <placeName corresp="#LOCHEARN">Earn</placeName>
                    in the poem <!-- apparatus and title to come -->"To Scotland", 
                    whereas he directs the spectator from the "grassy hills" to the clear and "starry" sky in

                    and from the "icicles . . . so near . . . so far" to the "trees . . . waving upon the rocks side" to the "mountains at a distance seen" in

                    As the guide book explains: "Being surrounded by hills", the village "has thus the double advantage of having a dry, 
                    wholesome, pure air, such as cannnot be found in low-lying places, and of being well sheltered from violent winds, 
                    or cold inclement blasts" (<title type="book" corresp="#JACKGLENFARG">Jack, Glenfarg and District Past an Present</title> [7th ed., n.d.], 3).</p>
                
                <p>In both of the <geogName corresp="#GLENFLARG">Glenfarg</geogName> poems, Ruskin mentions the "floury mills" with "the water wheel that turns slowly round / Grinding the corn". 
                    In the <date when="1840">1840s</date>, the Farn was still active with four mills for grinding corn, twenty-two thrashing mills, and a sawmill. 
                    According to the <date when="1908">1908</date> edition of the <geogName corresp="GLENFLARG">Glenfarg</geogName> guidebook, profits from this local production had been undercut by cheap imported flour,
                    and the meal and flour mills long closed, their "decaying walls" along the Farg 
                    "now silent as the grave, save when the winds sigh eerily" through them. If, according to the <date when="1908">1908</date> edition, 
                    "old people . . . in our parish" may have remembered the mills, by the <date when="1930">1930s</date> edition "no one now lives who was familiar with these meal mills in our parish"
