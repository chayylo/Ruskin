                    &#x201C;bringing ourselves under such responsibility&#x201D; by adopting relatives&#x02BC; children into the household 
                    (<title type="letter" corresp="mr_to_jjr_1826-05-15">Margaret to John James Ruskin, <date when="1826-05-15">15 May 1826</date></title>). 
                    Nonetheless, one year later, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> expressed &#x201C;how great a relief&#x201D; she felt owing to the arrangements for <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>&#x02BC;s sister, <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> to live
                    at <placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName> for at least some extended periods of time 
                    (<persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> referring, e.g., to having &#x201C;changed very much in my lessons for while <persName corresp="#MRC">mary</persName> was with me I said them very ill every day&#x201d;). 
                    Perhaps <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> was led to this exception by <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName>&#x02BC;s gender and personality, since in the same letter 
                    she conveyed to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> her satisfaction in having a female companion, a <persName corresp="#DEPREE">Miss DePree</persName>, to stay with her &#x201C;while you are away&#x201D; on business travel, 
                    &#x201C;and it seems to be her real desire to make herself useful and spare me trouble&#x201D; in such tasks as sewing and shopping. <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> 
                    may have been viewed in the same capacity

                <!-- START TAGGING HERE -->
                <p>Nonetheless, boundaries were maintained, as Mary was kept at school, Margaret reporting in May 1827 having only "seen her twice". 
                    An even harder line was drawn separating Herne Hill from the Richardsons of Croydon, Margaret remarking that her sister, 
                    <persName corresp="#BR">Bridget Richardson</persName>, felt "much mortification that Mary [i.e., apparently her daughter, <persName corresp="#MBR">Mary Bridget Richardson</persName>] 
                    is not to have her home with us" and "seems hurt that I should feel her child such a burden". 
                    (Had expectations for Mary Bridget of Croydon even been usurped by arrangements for Mary of Perth?)
                    Margaret confessed herself unequal to liberal demands on her affections, for "had I the love for hers [Bridget's children] 
                    she has for mine it would have been very different". Bridget's more capacious affections were "natural" given her "love for society", 
                    but Margaret needed a more limited and, one suspects, socially stratified circle, and she concluded these remarks that she 
                    "continue[d] to find Miss DePree a most desirable companion" 
                    (<title type="letter" corresp="mr_to_jjr_1827-05-08">Margaret to John James Ruskin, <date when="1827-05-08">8 May 1827</date></title>, in 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 162-63). 
                    A year later, following the death of the Perth <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName>&#x02BC;s mother, <ref type="note" target="richardson_jessie_note.php"><persName corresp="#JRP">Jessie Richardson</persName></ref>, in <date notBefore="1828-05-01" notAfter="1828-05-31">May 1828</date>, 
                    <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName>&#x02BC;s residence at <placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName> became permanent until her marriage.</p>
                <p>Mary's permanent residence had begun by January 1829, when Margaret Ruskin refers to Mary returning to school 
                    (<title type="letter" corresp="mr_to_jjr_1829-01-21">Margaret to John James Ruskin, <date when="1829-01-21">21 January 1829</date></title>). 
                    Arrangements for Mary's schooling appear in the earliest surviving household accounts kept by <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>, the ledger pages for 1827, 
                    which record a total payment for the year of &#x00A3;62.11.10 to <persName corresp="#EA">Miss Williamson</persName>. 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28">Account Book</ref>, 4v). 
                    Van Akin Burd was unable to locate a school listing operated by a Miss Williamson in directories, but quotes an 1830 letter by Mary to a cousin, 
                    describing a small school limited to twelve boarders and a few day scholars, "most of them . . . Scotch". The tuition consisted 
                    "Music, Drawing, and French;--and Geography, Dancing, Writing, and Arithmetic for two quarters", and "latterly . . . Italian" 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 164 n. 3). 
                    In May 1827, at the start of this tuition, Margaret reported that Mary "had not one bad mark for want of punctuallity and for all she is learning generally good ones" 
                    (<title type="letter" corresp="mr_to_jjr_1827-05-08">Margaret to John James Ruskin, <date when="1827-05-08">8 May 1827</date></title>, in 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 162).</p>
                <p>In John James's accounts, support of Mary's schooling is easily confused with the same support for Mary Bridget Richardson of Croydon. 
                    If the Ruskins refused to bring Mary Bridget into the family, John James did pay for her schooling, and she may have been Mary's schoolmate 
                    at Miss Williamson's. In the same January 1829 in which Margaret mentions Mary's resumption of school, she comments that she shall also 
                    "send" Bridget "instantly to school"; and in John James's accounts for 1828, a year's payments totaling &#x00A3;83.6.5 to Miss Williamson 
                    are listed under the heading "Mary Richardson Croydon", while for November of thqt yeqr a single payment of &#x00A3;19.6 is listed for 
                    "Mary Schoolg" under the heading "John, Mary, And[re]w, &#x0026; Will[ia]m Richardson [of Perth]". (Accounting for the discrepancy of less schooling for 
                    Mary Richardson, she would have returned to Perth that year in mourning for her mother.) For 1829, John James's accounts show a single entry 
                    in March of &#x00A3;38.7.1 for Mary Bridget Richardson's "June Schoolg", and two entries (in June and December) 
                    of &#x00A3;22.9.6 and &#x00A3;23.11.9 for Mary Richardson's "Schoolg". The accounts for 1830 record nothing for Mary Bridget's education, 
                    while Miss Williamson's name appears twice under the heading "John, Mary, And[re]w, &#x0026; Will[ia]m Richardson [of Perth]". There the girls' education apparently ended; 
                    for in 1831, the Ruskins were abroad for much of the year, and nothing is listed for the girls' schooling in 1832 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28">Account Book</ref>, 9r, 13r, 13v, 18r).</p>
