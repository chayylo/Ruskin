            <p>According to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I”</span></a>, the family holidayed in <span class="placeName">Hastings</span>, a journey from <span class="placeName">London</span> to <span class="placeName">Sussex</span> that presumably took place in <span class="date">1826</span> prior to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs composing his <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy”</span> narrative, although it is possible that the story refers to a previous season. Seaside
               resorts attracted the elder Ruskins from nearly <span class="date">the start of their marriage</span>, probably for their salubriousness to health as well as for pleasure (see <a class="link_ref" href="seaside_resorts_note.php"><span class="placeName">Seaside Resorts</span></a>, and see also <a class="link_ref" href="tours_of_1822-24_note.php">Tours of <span class="date">1822–24</span></a>).</p>
            <div class="section" id="ONEYEARORTWO">
               <h2><span class="headingNumber">1.1. </span><span class="head"><span class="placeName">Scotland</span>, <span class="date">1826</span>, <span class="date">1827</span>, or both?</span></h2>
               <p>The destinations of the Ruskin family tours of <span class="date">1826</span> and <span class="date">1827</span> were established by <span class="persName">W. G. Collingwood</span> in <a class="link_ref" href="poems_1891_note.php"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span> (<span class="date">1891</span>)</span></a>; and while the dates of those tours were revised, and the destinations refined, by
                  subsequent editors and biographers, the broad assumptions have not been challenged.
                  Those assumptions rest, however, on confusing evidence in the <a class="link_ref" href="red_book_note.php"><span class="titlem">Red Books</span></a>, and it may be that evidence referring apparently to two separate northern journeys,
                  of <span class="date">1826</span> and of <span class="date">1827</span>, in fact refer to a single tour of <span class="date">1827</span>.</p>
               <p><span class="persName">Collingwood</span> took as his first point of reference the poems <a class="link_ref" href="on_scotland_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“On Scotland”</span></a> in <a class="link_ref" href="msi_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS I</span></a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Glen of Glenfarg” (“Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill”)</span></a> in <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III</span></a>. The former, he declared, “record[s <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs] impressions received during a journey from <span class="placeName">Scotland</span> with his parents, after visiting his <span class="persName">aunt</span> at <span class="placeName">Perth</span>” in <span class="date">1826</span>. Specifically, he believed, the poem captured the return journey, given the poemʼs
                  trope of changes: one line “is no doubt a reminiscence of the <span class="date">May</span> sunshine in which they went northwards; for their start was usually made about the
                  middle of May; and [<span class="persName">Ruskin</span>] contrasts the sunny anticipation of the arrival with the autumnal gloom of the departure”
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JRPOEMS4D1891"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span> [4<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date">1891</span>]</span></a>, 1:xxii–xxiii; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JRPOEMS8D1891"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span> [8<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date">1891</span>]</span></a>, 1:ix). On the strength of this interpretation, <span class="persName">Collingwood</span> renamed this poem <span class="titlem">“Farewell to Scotland”</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="on_scotland_apparatus.php#TITLE">“To Scotland”: Title</a>).</p>
               <p>The latter portion of this interpretation, at the very least, has been disproved by
                  <span class="persName">Van Akin Burd</span>, who points out that, in <span class="date">May 1826</span>, <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span> was on the road beyond his <span class="date">10 May</span> birthday, as attested by his dated letters to <span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span> extending through the end of the month. Business had been lean that year, thus delaying
                  a family holiday (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="persName">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span></a>, 137, 139 n. 1, 150 n. 5, 137).</p>
               <p>Moreover, further upsetting the familyʼs routine, in <span class="date">April and May 1826</span> they coped with the consumptive decline and death of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="placeName">Perth</span> <span class="persName">cousin</span>, <a class="link_ref" href="richardson_james_note.php"><span class="persName">James Richardson</span></a>, who had been living at <a class="link_ref" href="herne_hill_note.php"><span class="placeName">Herne Hill</span></a> while working at <a class="link_ref" href="ruskin_telford_note.php"><span class="orgName">Ruskin, Telford, and Domecq</span></a>. By <span class="date">April</span>, <span class="persName">James</span>ʼs health had declined so alarmingly that he returned to his family in <span class="placeName">Perth</span>, possibly escorted on this journey by <span class="persName">John James</span> and <span class="persName">Margaret</span>. The youth died soon after his return, on <span class="date">8 May</span>, a few days before <span class="date"><span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs birthday</span>. When <span class="persName">John James</span> learned of his <span class="persName">nephew</span>ʼs death, he was traveling in the northwest, and he did not return home until <span class="date">the end of May</span> at the earliest (see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="persName">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span></a>, 139 n. 1, 149; see also <a class="link_ref" href="richardson_james_note.php"><span class="persName">James Richardson [<span class="date">1808–26</span>]</span></a>).</p>
               <p><span class="persName">Burd</span> states that “in <span class="date">April</span> the Ruskins took . . . <span class="persName">James</span> back to <span class="placeName">Perth</span>,” an inference that he presumably takes from <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs <a class="link_ref" href="mr_to_jjr_1826-05-07_al_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">letter</span> of <span class="date">7–8 May</span></a>, in which she reflects on <span class="persName">James</span>ʼs “journey up”. <span class="persName">Margaret</span> is reminding her husband that, on this journey, <span class="persName">James</span> “had none of that spirit which youths of his age usually have” so that “both you
                  &amp; I had repeatedly asked him if he was quite sure he was happy and . . . he had assured
                  us in the strongest terms he was”. While <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs comments leave some doubt about who made the trip with <span class="persName">James</span>, it seems unlikely that, even if both the elder Ruskins undertook this sad journey
                  to <span class="placeName">Perth</span>, they would have risked bringing <span class="persName">John</span>. Considering that <span class="persName">Margaret</span> warned <span class="persName">James</span>ʼs mother, <span class="persName">Jessie Richardson</span>, “that the children should not be much with . . . [<span class="persName">James</span>] for fear of infection” (referring to his brothers and sisters), it seems strange
                  that she would have exposed her own <span class="persName">son</span> during a long journey. <span class="persName">John</span> would also have stood a good chance of having to witness <span class="persName">James</span>ʼs death, since <span class="persName">Margaret</span> believed that “worlds could not save him”. She concluded this much “when <span class="persName">James</span> was at <span class="placeName">Croydon</span>”, referring to the house of her sister, <span class="persName">Bridget Richardson</span>. Thus, perhaps <span class="persName">John</span> was left with his <span class="placeName">Croydon</span> aunt, uncle, and cousins, while his parents carried <span class="persName">James</span> to <span class="placeName">Perth</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="mr_to_jjr_1826-05-07_al_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">letter of <span class="date">8 May 1826</span></span></a> [<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="persName">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span></a>, 134 n. 3, 142]).</p>
               <p>Did <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs fears prevent the family from journeying north in <span class="date">1826</span> altogether, even later in the year? While <span class="persName">Burd</span> corrects <span class="persName">Collingwood</span>ʼs assumption that the Scottish journey occurred in <span class="date">May</span>, he relies on the same evidence as does <span class="persName">Collingwood</span> to affirm that “the family probably went in <span class="date">September” 1826</span> to <span class="placeName">Scotland</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="persName">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span></a>, 150 n. 5). Both conclusions go back to the evidence of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem, <a class="link_ref" href="glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Glen of Glenfarg” (“Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill”)</span></a>, and to <span class="persName">Collingwood</span>ʼs belief that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> wrote it, like <a class="link_ref" href="on_scotland_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“On Scotland”</span></a>, either “during the journey home” from a <span class="date">spring</span> tour to <span class="placeName">Scotland</span> (which certainly did not occur), “or on his return [to <span class="placeName">London</span>], in <span class="date">September</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JRPOEMS4D1891"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span> [4<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date">1891</span>]</span></a>, 1:xxiii; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JRPOEMS8D1891"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span> [8<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date">1891</span>]</span></a>, 1:x).</p>
               <p>The <span class="date">September 1826</span> date for <a class="link_ref" href="glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Glen of Glenfarg” (“Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill”)</span></a> (even though contained in <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III</span></a>) comes from an annotation to that effect by <span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span> in the manuscript. (<span class="persName">Burd</span>, like <span class="persName">Collingwood</span>, attributes the gloss to <span class="persName">John James</span>, but the hand appears to be <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs.) It is possible that a <span class="date">September 1826</span> journey resulted in this poem along with the entirety of <a class="link_ref" href="msi_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS I</span></a> (including the <a class="link_ref" href="msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS I Poetry Anthology</span></a>, which contains <span class="titlem">“On Scotland”</span>), since in <a class="link_ref" href="msi_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS I</span></a> <span class="persName">Margaret</span> noted her <span class="persName">son</span> as having started <a class="link_ref" href="msi_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS I</span></a> at about that time, in <span class="date">September or October 1826</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php#DATE"><span class="titlem">“The Needless Alarm”</span>: Date</a>; and <a class="link_ref" href="msi_apparatus.php#DATE"><span class="titlem">MS I</span>: Date</a>). The available evidence does fit together tidily enough.</p>
               <p>Nonetheless, the evidence can also be read as supporting <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> a northern tour of <span class="date">1827</span>, and not tours of both <span class="date">1826</span> <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> <span class="date">1827</span>. The problem is that the only evidence of a northern journey contained in <a class="link_ref" href="msi_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS I</span></a> (the manuscript dated by <span class="persName">Margaret</span> as <span class="date">September or October 1826 through January 1827</span>) is <span class="titlem">“On Scotland”</span>—and that poem might be interpreted as <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs elegy on his cousin, <span class="persName">James</span>, rather than as a topographical poem based on eyewitness travel. The contents of
                  <a class="link_ref" href="msi_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS I</span></a> are principally taken up by <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I”</span></a>, and that tale is set entirely at <span class="placeName">Herne Hill</span> except for a holiday at <span class="placeName">Hastings</span>. That the family actually sought such a holiday on the <span class="placeName">Sussex</span> coast in <span class="date">summer 1826</span> is logical, given <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs concerns over her <span class="persName">husband</span>ʼs overwork and his distress about his <span class="persName">sister</span>ʼs children, and given <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs recommendation of summer sea bathing for health on previous occasions (see <a class="link_ref" href="mr_to_jjr_1826-05-05_al_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">letter of <span class="date">5 May 1826</span></span></a>, <a class="link_ref" href="mr_to_jjr_1826-05-07_al_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">letter of <span class="date">7 May 1826</span></span></a>, <a class="link_ref" href="mr_to_jjr_1826-05-07_al_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">letter of <span class="date">8 May 1826</span></span></a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="mr_to_jjr_1819-06-23_al_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">letter of <span class="date">23 June 1819</span></span></a>  [<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="persName">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span></a>, 138, 141, 95]). <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs trope of “change” in <span class="titlem">“On Scotland”</span> might then be read in terms of a number of disorientations that he learned about,
                  following that <span class="date">summer</span> holiday on the coast, including his deceased <span class="persName">cousin</span> in <span class="placeName">Perth</span>. (Another change, which may have occurred in <span class="placeName">Perth</span> at this time, was the removal of his <span class="persName">aunt</span>ʼs family from <span class="placeName">Bridge End House</span> on the east bank of the <span class="geogName">Tay River</span>, a house that was sold in <span class="date">May 1826</span> in settling the estate of <span class="persName">John</span>ʼs uncle, the late <a class="link_ref" href="richardson_patrick_note.php"><span class="persName">Patrick Richardson</span></a>, leaving the family with <span class="placeName">Rose Terrace</span> on the west side of the river, a house overlooking the <span class="placeName">North Inch</span>. This move may have occurred earlier, however, following <span class="persName">Patrick</span>ʼs death in <span class="date">1824</span>; see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="persName">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span></a>, 48 n. 1, 101 n. 2, and plates VIII, IX.)</p>
               <p>There is no question that the Scottish connections are strongest in <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III</span></a>, belonging to <span class="date">1827</span>. In <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_vol2_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2”</span></a>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> describes a visit to <span class="placeName">Rose Terrace</span>; and both of his poems about <a class="link_ref" href="glenfarg_place_note.php"><span class="geogName">Glenfarg</span></a>—the valley through which the family traveled to approach and/or depart from <span class="placeName">Perth</span>—are contained in that <a class="link_ref" href="red_book_note.php"><span class="titlem">Red Book</span></a>. Both poems, albeit in separate anthologies in <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III</span></a>, could date from <span class="date">late 1827</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Glen of Glenfarg” (“Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill”)</span></a> and <a class="link_ref" href="glenfarg_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Glen of Glenfarg” (“Papa how pretty those icicles are”)</span></a>. In fact, <span class="titlem">“Glen of Glenfarg” (“Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill”)</span> seems remarkably sophisticated compared to poems of <span class="date">1826–27</span> in <a class="link_ref" href="msi_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS I</span></a>. It is only <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs dating of that poem as <span class="date">September 1826</span> that lends credence to a journey to that region in that year.</p>
               <p>In the introduction to <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#TOURLAKES"><span class="persName">Burd</span> and <span class="persName">Dearden</span>, eds., <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Tour of the Lakes</span></span></a>, <span class="persName">Burd</span> rehearses the same set of poems not only as evidence for an <span class="date">1826</span> <span class="placeName">Scotland</span> journey, but also a visit to the <span class="geogName">Lake District</span> annexed to the same trip (“by way of <span class="placeName">Coniston</span> and <span class="placeName">Keswick</span>”) on the evidence of <a class="link_ref" href="on_skiddaw_and_derwentwater_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“On Skiddaw and Derwentwater”</span></a>. That poem, however, as <span class="persName">Burd</span> himself points out, was misdated as <span class="date">1828</span> by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs earlier editors, belonging in fact to <span class="date">1829</span>. The poem may not even have derived from travel, but from the extensive print and
                  visual culture associated with the <span class="geogName">Lake District</span>. <a class="link_ref" href="on_skiddaw_and_derwentwater_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“On Skiddaw and Derwentwater”</span></a> proves nothing, therefore, about the case for an <span class="date">1826</span> northern tour; nor does the remark <span class="persName">Burd</span> quotes by <span class="persName">John James</span> in a <a class="link_ref" href="jjr_to_mr_1827-02-21_al_apparatus.php"><span class="date">21 February 1827</span> <span class="titlem">letter</span></a> to <span class="persName">Margaret</span>, referring to “our delightful Journey together”, which may refer—not to <span class="placeName">Scotland</span> and the <span class="geogName">Lake District</span>, as <span class="persName">Burd</span> assumes—but merely to the <span class="placeName">Hastings</span> visit indicated in <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I”</span> (the remark does seem to refer to a journey taken in the previous year, <span class="date">1826</span>; see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="persName">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span></a>, 152; and <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#TOURLAKES"><span class="persName">Burd</span> and <span class="persName">Dearden</span>, eds., <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Tour to the Lakes</span></span></a>, 7).</p>
               <p>All of this is to say that some skepticism is warranted about the dates and destinations
                  of the Ruskin familyʼs earlier tours, evidence for which has, for more than a century,
                  turned on the dating of a few poems. Ultimately, the case hinges on <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs gloss of <a class="link_ref" href="glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Glen of Glenfarg” (“Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill”)</span></a> as <span class="date">September 1826</span>, and we cannot know precisely what she intended by that date. We also lack firm evidence
                  about the itinerary: even supposing that <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs remark to his <span class="persName">wife</span> about “our delightful Journey together” does refer to a northern journey in <span class="date">September 1826</span>—for which there is slender and ambiguous evidence—on what evidence would we conclude
                  that this journey included the <span class="geogName">Lake District</span> as well as <span class="placeName">Scotland</span>?</p>

               <p>That the family did make a northern journey in <span class="date">1827</span>—whether in reality the same as the alleged <span class="date">1826</span> journey, or a second one—is attested by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs detailed prose account in <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_vol2_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2”</span></a>, and by the complementary anthology of topographical poetry, <a class="link_ref" href="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Poetry Discriptive”</span></a>, contained in the same <a class="link_ref" href="red_book_note.php"><span class="titlem">Red Book</span></a>, <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III</span></a>. The highlights of that journey included the <span class="geogName">Wye Valley</span> in southern <span class="placeName">Wales</span>, followed by the ride north to <span class="placeName">Perth</span> in <span class="placeName">Scotland</span>. Since <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="persName">cousin</span> from <span class="placeName">Perth</span>, <a class="link_ref" href="richardson_mary_note.php"><span class="persName">Mary Richardson</span> (<span class="date">1815–49</span>)</a>, had been staying with the Ruskins at <span class="placeName">Herne Hill</span>, and was still living in the house in <span class="date">May</span>, it seems likely that she traveled with the family for a return visit home to <span class="placeName">Scotland</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="mr_to_jjr_1827-04-28_al_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">letter of <span class="date">28 April 1827</span></span></a> [<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="persName">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span></a>, 156–57]).</p>
               <p>As in the preceding year, <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span> was occupied by his business travels for orders well beyond his <span class="date">10 May birthday</span>, so the family could not have departed on holiday at that time—<span class="persName">Margaret</span> advising her <span class="persName">husband</span> on <span class="date">May 15</span> against “coming home” too early only “to have to go away” again on business and thereby
                  “increase your fatigue by bringing you twice over the same ground” before he could
                  consider work completed (<a class="link_ref" href="mr_to_jjr_1827-05-15_al_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">letter of <span class="date">15 May 1827</span></span></a> [<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="persName">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span></a>, 157 n. 1, 166–67]). Meanwhile, <span class="persName">John</span> expressed his wanderlust with poems sent to his <span class="persName">father</span> in a letter of <span class="date">May 1827</span>, prior to the holiday—the poems, <a class="link_ref" href="wales_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Wales”</span></a> and <a class="link_ref" href="spring_blank_verse_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Spring: Blank Verse”</span></a>, indicating that the itinerary was already planned.</p>
               <p>In <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs household accounts ledger, the “Sundries” for <span class="date">June 1827</span> include “Northcotes visit 25/”. If this means a visit to <span class="placeName">Herne Hill</span> by the painter, <a class="link_ref" href="northcote_james_note.php"><span class="persName">James Northcote</span> (<span class="date">1746–1831</span>)</a>, then the family was at home during that month; and the entry for the following month,
                  <span class="date">July</span>, includes “Gown my sister £4.4”, presumably a gift for <a class="link_ref" href="richardson_jessie_note.php"><span class="persName">Jessie Richardson</span></a> to be carried north. <span class="date">August</span> has an entry “chaise Perth <span class="unclear">M.<sup>t</sup>[?][?]</span> £2.18”, an expense related to arranging for the post‐chaise to carry the family to
                  <span class="placeName">Perth</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="travelling_carriages_note.php">Traveling Carriages</a>). There are no entries for <span class="date">September</span> and <span class="date">October</span>, the accounts resuming in <span class="date">November</span> with items suggesting a departure from <span class="placeName">Perth</span>: “postage Perth £3.15/”; “Freights <span class="unclear">pres<sup>t</sup>[?][?]</span> 47/7”; “Servants Perth 5/ £6.6”; and <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#KITCHINERTRAVELLERSORACLE">“Travellers Oracle 12/”</a>, a book comprising songs and other diversions for road travel by <span class="persName">William Kitchiner</span>, along with his revision of “Horse and Carriage Keeperʼs Oracle” by an “Old Coachman”,
                  <span class="persName">John Jervis</span>. It appears, then, that the <span class="placeName">Perth</span> visit in <span class="date">1827</span> took place mainly in <span class="date">September and October</span>, with departure from <span class="placeName">London</span> probably in <span class="date">August</span> and return in <span class="date">November</span>. Confirming these parameters, the “House Expenses” (i.e., groceries and other household
                  consumables) in <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs accounts for that year skip from an entry for <span class="date">July</span> to one for <span class="date">December</span>, the latter including the items “At Perth Aug.<sup>t</sup> £5 Perth £12 £4”. The “Expenses Travelling” for the year lists an item under <span class="date">December</span>, “To Scotland &amp; back £215” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span>, <span class="titlem">Account Book [<span class="date">1827–45</span>]</span></a>, 2r, 2v, 5v).</p>
               <p>According to the prose account of the journey in <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_vol2_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2”</span></a>, the itinerary took the Ruskins first to <span class="placeName">Salt Hill</span>, a major stage west of <span class="placeName">London</span>, opening to the <span class="placeName">Great West Road</span>; however, rather than heading west toward <span class="placeName">Bristol</span>, the Ruskins turned northwest to <span class="placeName">Oxford</span>, where they stayed briefly to view the colleges. They proceeded through <span class="placeName">Gloucester</span>, presumably on a straight path to <span class="placeName">Ross‐on‐Wye</span>, an established launching place for a tour of the <span class="geogName">Wye Valley</span>, but <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs account next mentions <span class="placeName">Monmouth</span>. It is not clear, therefore, whether the prose account accurately describes the sequence
                  of the itinerary. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> describes <span class="placeName">Tintern Abbey</span> at length, followed by a reference to <span class="placeName">Windcliff</span>–one of the eminences surrounding the dramatic bend in the river that encloses the
                  peninsula of <span class="placeName">Lancaut</span>–but the narrative neglects to mention <span class="placeName">Raglan Castle</span>, which figures prominently as the subject of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem in <a class="link_ref" href="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Poetry Discriptive”</span></a>. Thus, it seems likely that the travel narrative and poetry anthology are governed
                  less by concerns for accuracy, like a memoir, than by the high points of picturesque
                  viewing (indeed, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy”</span> purports to be a fictionalized lesson in the manner the <span class="titlem">Edgeworthsʼ series of lessons</span>, and not autobiographical; see <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_apparatus.php#DISCUSSION"><span class="titlem">MS III</span>: Discussion</a>). <span class="placeName">Windcliff</span>, for example, was known primarily as a picturesque spot–one of the elevated views
                  over the river from the <span class="placeName">Piercefield estate</span>, famous for its picturesque walks developed during the age of <span class="persName">Capability Brown</span> (<span class="date">1716–83</span>) (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ANDREWSPICTURESQUE">Andrews, <span style="font-style:italic">Search for the Picturesque</span></a>, 105–7).</p>
               <p>Wearied with another challenging year for his business, <span class="persName">John James</span> perhaps welcomed an excursion through the <span class="geogName">Wye Valley</span> which offered provisions for easy travel that had been honed to commercial efficiency
                  by three‐quarters of a century of popular picturesque viewing. From the <span class="date">1760s through the turn of the century</span>, the preferred modes for experiencing the dramatic features along the craggy banks
                  of the river were by water or by foot (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ANDREWSPICTURESQUE"><span class="persName">Andrews</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Search for the Picturesque</span></span>, 84–107</a>). By the <span class="date">1820s</span>, however, the Ruskins would have benefited from easier carriage access owing to road
                  improvements, including a new turnpike from <span class="placeName">Chepstow</span> and a carriageway from <span class="placeName">Monmouth</span> to <span class="placeName">Raglan Castle</span>; and in the year of their journey, the Ruskins could have observed an industrial‐age
                  iron bridge under construction at <span class="placeName">Bigsweir</span>, midway between <span class="placeName">Tintern</span> and <span class="placeName">Monmouth</span>. If they left their carriage for a water excursion, they could have embarked on one
                  of the steam packets that had been operating throughout the <span class="date">1820s</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#MATHESONHEATH"><span class="persName">Matheson</span>, <span class="titlem">“<span class="persName">Charles Heath</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic">Historical and Descriptive Accounts of the Ancient and Present State of <span class="placeName">Tintern Abbey</span></span>”</span></a>, 141).</p>
               <p>Insofar as the sequence of landmarks in <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_vol2_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2”</span></a>, can be trusted, the family took the length of the <span class="geogName">Wye Valley</span> excursion at least from <span class="placeName">Monmouth</span> to <span class="placeName">Tintern Abbey</span> (the tour normally departing from <span class="placeName">Ross‐on‐Wye</span> and ending at <span class="placeName">Chepstow</span>). At <span class="placeName">Monmouth</span>, a short ride would have brought the visitors to <span style="font-style:italic">Raglan Castle</span>, prompting <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <a class="link_ref" href="ragland_castle_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">poem</span> of that name</a>. <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III</span></a> includes a drawing entitled <a class="link_ref" href="bristol_channel_drawing_msiii.php"><span class="titlem">“Picture of the Bristol Channel”</span></a>, showing open water crowded with both large ships under full sail and smoking steamboats,
                  so it appears likely that the Ruskins continued to <span class="placeName">Chepstow</span> and even beyond into the <span class="geogName">Bristol Channel</span>.</p>
               <p>To guide them on the <span class="geogName">Wye</span> tour, the Ruskins are likely to have used an edition of the guidebook, <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#HEATHRAGLANDCASTLE"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Historical and Descriptive Accounts of the Ancient and Present State of <span class="placeName">Ragland Castle</span></span></span></a> by the <span class="placeName">Monmouth</span> printer, <span class="persName">Charles Heath</span> (<span class="date">1761–1830</span>), and possibly also his <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#HEATHTINTERN"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Historical and Descriptive Accounts of the Ancient and Present State of <span class="placeName">Tintern Abbey</span></span></span></a>. Not only were these guidebooks popular and widely available, but there is also evidence
                  of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs close attention to <span class="persName">Heath</span>ʼs approach to interpreting the castle and abbey ruins. A drawing in <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III</span></a> is entitled <a class="link_ref" href="ragland_castle_drawing_msiii.php"><span class="titlem">“Ragland Castle When Newly Built”</span></a>, an idea that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> may have borrowed from <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Historical and Descriptive Accounts of the Ancient and Present State of Ragland Castle</span></span>, in which <span class="persName">Heath</span> organizes information under the two heads, “The Castle in Its Present State, as It
                  Is Now Shewn” and “The Castle in Its Splendor”—the latter reconstructing the castleʼs
                  past state, “when newly built”, as <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> puts it.</p>
               <p>The travel narrative in <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_vol2_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2”</span></a>, next jumps to <span class="placeName">Perth</span> in <span class="placeName">Scotland</span>, without explaining how the Ruskins traveled there from <span class="placeName">Wales</span>—except, “<span class="persName">Harry</span>” says, that they went by sea on a steamboat. Unless the sea voyage is fanciful, it
                  is quite possible that the Ruskins traveled by sea from <span class="placeName">Wales</span> to <span class="placeName">Glasgow</span>, and then west to east on the <span class="geogName">Clyde River</span>, through the <span class="geogName">Forth and Clyde Canal</span>, and then on the <span class="geogName">Forth River</span> to <span class="placeName">Leith</span>. For details concerning this route, see <a class="link_ref" href="tours_of_1822-24_note.php">Tours of <span class="date">1822–24</span></a>, in which the Ruskins may previously has used this water passage to reach <span class="placeName">Perth</span>. The passage from <span class="placeName">Wales</span> to <span class="placeName">Scotland</span> could also have presented an opportunity to turn south on the mainland and visit
                  some portion of the <span class="geogName">Lake District</span> before heading to <span class="placeName">Glasgow</span>.</p>
               <p>Places mentioned in <span class="placeName">Scotland</span> are <span class="placeName">Kinross</span>, <span class="placeName">Lochleven</span>, and <span class="placeName">Perth</span>. Returning south, the Ruskins crossed at <span class="placeName">Queensferry</span> for <span class="placeName">Edinburgh</span>; and they continued south along the <span class="placeName">Great North Road</span> to <span class="placeName">Haddington</span>, <span class="placeName">Berwick‐upon‐Tweed</span>, <span class="placeName">Alnwick</span>, <span class="placeName">Newcastle upon Tyne</span>, <span class="placeName">Durham</span>, <span class="placeName">Darlington</span>, <span class="placeName">Boroughbridge</span>, <span class="placeName">Ferrybridge</span>, and <span class="placeName">Doncaster</span>. There the narrative is sliced off, with the promise: “But I will put them on to
                  <span class="placeName">scarthing moor</span> [near <span class="placeName">Newark‐on‐Trent</span>] in another chapter”.</p>
