                <head type="title">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</head>
                <p>Annuals were anthologies of verse, short fiction, and pictures&#x2014;the latter typically reproduced by engraving&#x2014;which were intended to serve as gifts and tokens of friendship. 
                    Combining literary and pictorial interest, the annuals were essentially ekphrastic collections, 
                    in that they tended to privilege pictures, and situated writing in relation to a picture in some fashion. 
                    Often, writers were hired to write to an engraving, rather than the artist illustrating existing tales or verse, 
                    just as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> composed his poem, <ref type="apparatus" target="saltzburg_apparatus.php">&#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#SALTZBURG">Saltzburg</title>&#x201D;</ref> in response to an engraved view of the city. 
                    As a form of gift publication, the annuals were published toward the end of a given year, 
                    typically in November in time for the holiday season of Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s; hence, their titles named the year following that of their actual publication. 
                    For example, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s first appearance in an annual was in the volume entitled 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835"><title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath: A Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present for MDCCCXXXV</hi></title></ref>, 
                    which went to press as early as <date when="1834-08">August 1834</date>, to be available for purchase before <date when="1834-12">December</date> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#VIGNEPRINGLE">Vigne, <hi rend="italic">Thomas Pringle</hi></ref>, 244). 
                    The annuals first emerged in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, quickly becoming a distinctive feature of early Victorian print culture, 
                    and they were widely popular with the middle and upper classes by the time <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> began publishing in them in the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>.

                    <head type="section">History and Development</head>
                    <p>The first British annual was <title type="anthology" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT" rend="italic">Forget Me Not</title>, published by the firm of <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> in <date when="1822">1822</date>, for the holiday season of <date notBefore="1822-11" notAfter="1823-02">1822&#x2013;23</date>. 
                        <persName corresp="#RAP">Rudolf Ackermann</persName> (<date notBefore="1764" notAfter="1834">1764&#x2013;1834</date>) as a publisher&#x2014;putting aside his many other interests and entrepreneurial successes&#x2014;was known primarily for his high quality, extravagant topographical books, 
                        usually illustrated by brightly hand&#x2010;colored aquatints. For the <title type="anthology" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT" rend="italic">Forget Me Not</title>, <persName corresp="#RAP">Ackermann</persName> hit upon a successful blend 
                        of polite and sentimental verse, tales, and engraved illustration aimed at middle&#x2010; and upper&#x2010;class consumers, especially women, 
                        who already formed the primary audience for the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm&#x02BC;s in&#x2010;house magazine, 
                        the <title type="periodical" corresp="#REPOSITORYOFARTS" rend="italic">Repository of Arts</title> (<date when="1809">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828">28</date>). 
                        The magazine&#x02BC;s editor, <persName corresp="#FS">Frederic Shoberl</persName> (<date notBefore="1775" notAfter="1853">1775&#x2013;1853</date>), did double duty as the editor of the <title type="anthology" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT" rend="italic">Forget Me Not</title> 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FORDACKERMANN"><persName corresp="#JFORD">Ford</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#FORDACKERMANN"><hi rend="italic">Ackermann</hi></title></ref>, 70, 64&#x2013;65, 80&#x2013;83).
                    </p>
                    <p>According to <persName corresp="#AR">Anne Renier</persName>, <persName corresp="#RAP">Ackermann</persName> based his creation on a combination of two models, the German <hi rend="italic">Taschenbuch</hi>, and the British &#x201C;pocket book.&#x201D; 
                        The former kind of publication offered the literary contents and illustration for which the British annuals became known, 
                        whereas the latter kind were familiar to British consumers as supplying tables of useful information along with blank or illustrated pages for the owner&#x02BC;s memoranda 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RENIERFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><persName corresp="#AR">Renier</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#RENIERFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title></ref>, 5&#x2013;6). 
                        To this ancestry of the annual, <persName corresp="#KDH">Katherine Harris</persName> adds the printed traditions of the emblem book and the almanac, 
                        as well as the homemade fashions of the lady&#x02BC;s album and the scrapbook, which were compiled by hand for personal collecting, 
                        although the cover and blank pages may have been manufactured 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISBORROWING"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HARRISBORROWING">&#x201C;Borrowing, Altering, and Perfecting the Literary Annual Form&#x201D;</title></ref>).
                        (Some confusion of terms arises from the similarity between the German <hi rend="italic">Taschenbuch</hi> 
                        and the English <hi rend="italic">pocket book</hi>, both terms referring to the publications&#x02BC; portable size, 
                        but the German form was literary, whereas the English <date notBefore="1701" notAfter="1800">eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> pocket book was akin to the almanac and diary.)
                    </p>
                    <p><date notBefore="1701" notAfter="1800">Eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> pocket books resembled almanacs by including reference information, especially tables of facts that were deemed appropriate 
                        for fashionable readers, such as lists of the members of the British royalty, the crowned heads of <geogName corresp="#EUROPE">Europe</geogName>, and names of other dignitaries. 
                        This convention appealed to <persName corresp="#RAP">Ackermann</persName>, since he marketed his books and art supplies primarily to leisured and wealthy clientele, 
                        and accordingly the first <title type="anthology" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT" rend="italic">Forget Me Not</title> included a &#x201C;General Summary of Houses, Families, and Persons in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Great Britain</placeName>, in <date when="1821">1821</date>,&#x201D; along with tables of other demographic 
                        information about <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#WALES">Wales</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>. 
                        This first British annual also reflected the original use of the pocket book as an engagement calendar,   
                        presenting a series of emblematic treatments of the twelve months, reproduced from copper engravings 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JUNGSTOTHARD"><persName corresp="#SJUNG">Jung</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#JUNGSTOTHARD">&#x201C;Print Culture, Marketing, and Thomas Stothard&#x02BC;s Illustrations for <hi rend="italic">The Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</hi>, 1779&#x2013;1826&#x201D;</title></ref>, 31;

                    </p>
                    <p>After the first <title type="anthology" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT" rend="italic">Forget Me Not</title>, the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm dropped the almanac features; and according to <persName corresp="#KDH">Katherine Harris</persName>, by <date when="1825">1825</date> 
                        all annuals had abandoned presentation of fashionably useful information in favor of strictly literary and pictorial contents 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISBORROWING"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HARRISBORROWING">&#x201C;Borrowing, Altering, and Perfecting the Literary Annual Form&#x201D;</title></ref>, 7).
                        Nonetheless, the annuals reflected lasting legacies of the pocket book, characteristics that point to the original uses of the earlier ephemeral print items. 
                        One legacy was the publication schedule of pocket books, which were released on the market in the autumn for purchase as Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s presents. 
                        Pocket books, like modern calendars, usually lost value after the beginning of the New Year, 
                        and it was to avoid this obsolescence that the almanac material was dropped from the early annuals 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED"><persName corresp="#BH">Hunnisett</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED"><hi rend="italic">Steel&#x2010;Engraved Book Illustration in England</hi></title></ref>, 139). 
                        For example, in an early volume of the annual, <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>, the editor, <persName corresp="#TKH">T. K. Hervey</persName>, 
                        announced his intention to remove &#x201C;all those features which marked&#x201D; the publication &#x201C;as more peculiarly adapted 
                        for one season of the year than another&#x201D; and to raise the production above the annuals&#x02BC; &#x201C;toy&#x2010;like attributes&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliiography" target="bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName>, ed., <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> [1826]</ref>, vi).
                        Nonetheless, the annuals retained the pattern of publishing in the autumn of one year a title that was meant &#x201C;for&#x201D; the following year. 
                        Thus, the first <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not: A Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present for <date when="1823">1823</date></hi></title> was published in <date when="1822-10">October 1822</date> 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FORDACKERMANN"><persName corresp="#JFORD">Ford</persName>, <title type="bibliography" corresp="#FORDACKERMANN"><hi rend="italic">Ackermann</hi></title></ref>, 65).
                    </p>
                    <p>Another legacy of the pocket book was consumers&#x02BC; perception of this niche of print culture as representing elegant, but not costly mementos. 
                        In the case of a shrewdly produced and marketed pocket book, 
                        such as <title type="manual_guide" corresp="#ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS" rend="italic">The Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</title> (<date when="1779">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1826">1826</date>), the ephemeral publication could anticipate the literary annual 
                        by being turned into permanent keepsakes. The publisher commissioned sophisticated, historical&#x2010; or literary&#x2010;themed engravings that were worth preserving, 
                        and the pocket book was available in a range of bindings, from functional to elegant. 
                        Owners, too, transformed the ephemeral publication into a keepsake, by dedicating the diary pages to memoranda more lasting than notes about engagements, 
                        and in some cases by decorating copies with precious handmade coverings, presumably to serve as personal gifts 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JUNGSTOTHARD"><persName corresp="#SJUNG">Jung</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#JUNGSTOTHARD">&#x201C;Print Culture, Marketing, and Thomas Stothard&#x02BC;s Illustrations for <hi rend="italic">The Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</hi>, 1779&#x2013;1826&#x201D;</title></ref>, 34&#x2013;36). 
                        With the addition of embellishments to the diary pages, such as the vignettes on literary themes heading the otherwise blank pages of the 
                        <title type="manual_guide" corresp="#ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS" rend="italic">Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</title>, pocket books of this class were produced well into the <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth century</date>, 
                        and they even began themselves to feature literary content in response to&#x2014;and even anticipating&#x2014;the impact of the annuals 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JUNGILLUSTRATED"><persName corresp="#SJUNG">Jung</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#JUNGILLUSTRATED">&#x201C;The Illustrated Pocket Diary&#x201D;</title></ref>, 25, 33, 36;

                        After the reign of the annuals had passed, the later Victorians found it easy to mock the often run&#x2010;of&#x2010;the&#x2010;mill contents of these publications, 
                        which alternated between simpering sentiment and melodramatic horror, but the grown&#x2010;up Victorians could not so easily escape the influence of the annuals&#x02BC; images

                   <p>One great significance of <persName corresp="#AWEDITOR">Watts&#x02BC;s</persName> <title type="anthology" corresp="#LITERARYSOUVENIR" rend="italic">Literary Souvenir</title> lay in the introduction of steel engraving to the annuals&#x2014;that is, 
                       intaglio printing from a steel plate. Typically, the steel plate was covered with an etching ground, 
                       which was engraved by an etching needle in preparation for etching by acid, and then the image was further worked using a burin. 
                       Because steel is much harder than copper, its durability increased the viability of print runs to the thousands of impressions, 
                       compared to the few hundreds of impressions possible from a copper plate, 
                       which rapidly wore thin from the abrasion of wiping

                       While copper rapidly yields lighter and dimmer impressions, its more pliable surface is easier to engrave than stubborn steel; 
                       and therefore innovations were required to make steel practicable for this use, 
                       such as softening the steel for engraving and then hardening the plate.

                   <p>In book illustration, 
                       the literary annuals were among the first kinds of publications to profit from the new technique.

                    <p>Another feature of the annuals that set apart these publications as especially desirable consumer items was their rich bindings. 
                        The first annuals were covered with glazed paper boards that were printed with a design framing the title, 
                        and the volumes were protected by a slipcase of the same materials and printed design. By the 
                        <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1829">final quarter of the 1820s</date>, these paper and cloth bindings were being outdone by silk, 
                        which was regarded as not only a luxurious and feminine material but also as supplanting the need for a slipcase. 
                        In <date when="1827">1827</date>, however, all this showiness was trumped by

                        were called <hi rend="italic">arabesque</hi>, incorporating floral and other pictorial elements. The arabesque pattern 
                        was distinguished from <hi rend="italic">cathedral</hi> patterns, which were associated with devotional publications. 
                        A cheaper alternative means of embossing was to employ 
                        <hi rend="italic">engine&#x2010;turned</hi> designs, resulting in the fine&#x2010;lined ornaments developed originally for bank notes. 
                        But by the <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1829">final quarter of the 1820s</date>, arabesque designs could as well be produced by machine 
                        (pp. 10&#x2013;13, and see 7&#x2013;14). 
                        Indeed, the flamboyance, yet relative inexpensiveness, of these bindings, which anticipate the ornate fancifulness 
                        achieved in the heyday of Victorian bookbinding,

                            &#x201C;so as to make it a drawing&#x2010;room book&#x201D;.  
                        To this effort, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> subscribed generously

                            Had it appeared, the book might have taken a place in the Ruskin family mythology alongside <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>, 
                            since both <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> and <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> served personally as mentors to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>

                    <p><persName corresp="#CTH">Heath</persName> secured famous poets&#x02BC; 
                        contributions to the <title type="annual" corresp="#KEEPSAKE"><hi rend="italic">Keepsake</hi></title>, by enticing them with 
                        offers of cash that were so princely that he fatally strained relations with 
                        his publishers, the firms of <orgName corresp="#JENNINGS">Robert Jennings</orgName> and of 
                        <orgName corresp="#HURST">Hurst, Chance</orgName>. These ambitious schemes suggest that <persName corresp="#CTH">Heath</persName> was interested less in promoting 
                        landscape art per se than in promoting and rewarding himself, rather than 
                        publishers, with the proceeds of his talent for steel engraving; however, 
                        <persName corresp="#BH">Basil Hunnisett</persName> may be correct to credit <persName corresp="#CTH">Heath</persName> 
                        at least incidentally with the development of the

                        imitators, such as the <title type="annual" corresp="#CONTINENTALANNUAL1832"><hi rend="italic">Continental Annual and Romantic Cabinet</hi></title>, published in <date when="1832">1832</date> by

                    </p>
                    <p>At the same time, viewed in a longer perspective, 
                        the landscape annual can be situated in the broader context of travel writing and illustration, 
                        in which the steel&#x2010;engraved landscape annuals formed a stage between the British copper&#x2010;engraved topographical and antiquarian magazines 
                        published <date notBefore="1770" notAfter="1819">between the last three decades of the eighteenth century and first two decades of the nineteenth</date>, 
                        and the magazines promoting the etching revival <date notBefore="1870" notAfter="1899">in the final three decades of the nineteenth century</date> 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ROBERTSBRITISHARTPERIODICALS"><persName corresp="#HEROBERTS">Roberts</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#ROBERTSBRITISHARTPERIODICALS">&#x201C;British Art Periodicals of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries&#x201D;</title></ref>, 3&#x2013;4). 
                        In this context, for the Ruskins, the landscape annuals belong to the category of topographical 
                        poetry and prose, such as <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> by 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="rogers_samuel_note.php"><persName corresp="#SR">Samuel Rogers</persName> (<date notBefore="1763" notAfter="1855">1763&#x2013;1855</date>)</ref>; 
                        pictorial travelogues, with or without letterpress, such as 
                        <title type="artwork" corresp="#PROUTSKETCHES" rend="italic">Facsimiles of Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany</title> by 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="prout_samuel_note.php"><persName corresp="#SP">Samuel Prout</persName> (<date when="1783">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852">1852</date>)</ref>; 
                        and <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="travel_narratives_and_guidebooks_note.php">Travel Narratives and Guidebooks</ref>. 
                        Topographical poetry, travel narrative, and landscape illustration were often included in annuals that were not specifically landscape annuals; 
                        an example is <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own first contribution to an annual, the poem 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="saltzburg_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</ref>, published in <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>. 
                        Unlike the illustrated literary annuals, however, which typically 
                        anthologized a miscellany of verse and prose along with illustrations of both landscapes and figures, which were contributed by a variety of writers and artists, 
                        the landscape annuals featured a single artist paired with a single writer of the letterpress. Although subordinated to the artist, 
                        the writer for a landscape annual could, like <persName corresp="#LR">Leitch Ritchie</persName>, 
                        see himself as contributing &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> sketches of his own&#x201D; 
                        (qtd. in  <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED"><persName corresp="#BH">Hunnisett</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED"><hi rend="italic">Steel&#x2010;Engraved Book Illustration in England</hi></title></ref>, 147).

                    <p>Another illustrated publication of the period, one that shared the medium of steel engraving with the annuals, but not their fancy bindings, 
                        was the collected edition of poetry or prose by a British author, gathered into uniformly bound volumes, which were solidly but inexpensively produced. 
                        The Ruskins had first&#x2010;hand experience of these editions in the <title type="series" corresp="#SCOTTMAGNUM">Magnum Opus</title> of <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>>, 
                        which started the trend, and they witnessed the failed attempt by

                        to complete such an edition of the <title type="anthology" corresp="#ALTRIVETALES" rend="italic">Altrive Tales</title>. In order to economize, these editions featured only a few illustrations per volume, 
                        but publishers made up the deficiency by selling portfolios of prints, which collectors could bind either separately or along with the uniform edition in question
