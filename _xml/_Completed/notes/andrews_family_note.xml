                <p>See <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="andrews_edward_note.php">Edward Andrews (1787-1841)</ref> for information about 
                    this celebrated Congregationalist preacher, who was the Ruskins' clergyman when they attended Dissenting chapel, and who served as Ruskin's first tutor, 
                    instructing him from age ten in Latin and Greek. Andrews and his wife Elizabeth (1792-1831) bore twelve children, of whom the eldest daughter, Eliza (1816-92), 
                    appears to have had some connection with the Ruskins during John's youth. Eliza's younger sister, Emily Augusta (1824-62), 
                    married Coventry Patmore (1823-96) and became known as the eponymous heroine of Patmore's <title type="poem" corresp="#PATMOREANGEL"><hi rend="italic">Angel in the House</hi></title>.</p>
                
                <p>In Praeterita, Ruskin mentions the sisters together: "Miss Andrews, the eldest sister of the 'Angel in the House', was an extremely beautiful girl of seventeen; 
                    she sang 'Tambourgi, Tambourgi' with great spirit and a rich voice, went at blackberry time on rambles with us at the Norwood Spa, 
                    and made me feel generally that there was something in girls that I did not understand, and that was curiously agreeable". 
                    As noted by the editors of the Library Edition, Eliza, as Mrs. Charles Orme, maintained a salon, which was frequented by the Pre-Raphaelites 
                    (Works, 35:73-74, 74 n. 1).</p>
                
                <p>Some verse by Eliza, <title type="poem" corresp="#ANDREWSELIZABRAVEHUSSAR">&#x201C;The Brave Hussar&#x201D;</title>, was copied by 
                    <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> in Ruskin's <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msvi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title></ref>. 
                    The eldest son, Edward, contributed poetry to his father's short-lived periodical, <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title>, 
                    which was also the venue for Ruskin's first published poems 
                    (see <ref type="apparatus" target="on_skiddaw_and_derwentwater_apparatus#DISCUSSION.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water&#x201D;: Discussion</title></ref>.</p>
                
                <p>A daughter of Eliza and Charles Orme (ca. 1807-93, also named Eliza Orme (1848&#x2013;1937), earned the degree of LLB from the University of London 
                    and was a practicing lawyer, as well as a feminist and writer on women's issues. Her relevance to <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> 
                    lies in her sharing a rare copy of her grandfather's magazine, the <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title>, 
                    with H. Robertson Nicoll, enabling him to track down Ruskin's first publications, the two poems that appeared in its pages in 1829 and 1830 (see 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="on_skiddaw_and_derwentwater_apparatus.php#REDISCOVERYBYNICOLL">"On Skiddaw and Derwent Water": <persName corresp="#HRN">Nicoll</persName>&#x02BC;s Discovery of the <hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi> Ruskin Publications</ref>). 
                    Since Eliza Orme was unmarried and lived with her parents until their deaths in 1892 and 1893 (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ORMEDNB"><persName corresp="#LHOWSAM">Howsam</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#ORMEDNB">&#x201C;Orme, Eliza [<date notBefore="1848" notAfter="1937">1848&#x2013;1937</date>]&#x201D;</title></ref>), 
                    she perhaps was custodian of this legacy of her grandfather. Nicoll published his findings in 1895.
