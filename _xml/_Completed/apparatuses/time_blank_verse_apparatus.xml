                            <p>The idea of <hi rend="italic">time</hi> as a trope for a New Year's poem may derive from the <date when="1826-01">January 1826</date> issue of the 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="evangelical_magazine_note.php"><title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title></ref>. 
                            For each January issue of the magazine, it had become a tradition to devote the monthly "Poetry" section to verse heralding the New Year. 
                            For the January 1826 issue--the latest New Year's issue that Ruskin could have seen before beginning his own poem--the poem &#x201C;For the New Year&#x2014;1826&#x201C; 
                            is subheaded &#x201C;Time&#x201D; like Ruskin's own poem for the New Year. The magazine's poet is <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#ALIQUIS">Aliquis</persName>, a contributor 
                            who gained almost exclusive ownership over this annual feature, developing the genre into a complex, multipart ode that filled the allotted space for poetry 
                            (see <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="new_years_poems_note.php#ODE_TRADITION">New Year&#x02BC;s Poems: The New Year&#x02BC;s Ode Tradition in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title></ref>).</p>
                            
                            <p>Aliquis's ode for 1826 is divided into three parts, the two enclosing parts each entitled &#x201C;Time&#x201D;, 
                                and the middle part entitled &#x201C;Eternity&#x201D;. An epigraph for the whole of the ode contextualizes the opening question of Ruskin's poem, 
                                "whats time a figure or a sense". Aliquis quotes Hosea 12:10, "I have used similitudes" 
                                (the Lord says: "I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets"). 
                                In the first part, "Time", Aliquis proceeds to multiply similitudes, each stanza consisting of a series of figures that compare to an attribute of time. 
                                For example, in stanza one, subtitled "Swift" as one attribute of time, each line presents a similitude to the swift passage of time, 
                                reserving the final line to summarize the attribute in the subtitle:</p>

                            The father defines an <hi rend="italic">emblem</hi> as "'a visible image of an invisible thing'" and goes on to explain:</p>

                                        <p>"There are certain notions that we form in our minds without the help of our eyes, or any of our <hi rend="italic">senses</hi>. 
                                            Thus, Virtue, Vice, Honour, Disgrace, Time, Death, and the like, are not sensible objects, but ideas of the understanding. . . . 
                                            Now it sometimes happens that we wish to represent one of these in a visible form; that is, to offer something to the sight 
                                            that shall raise a similar notion in the minds of the beholders. In order to do this, we must take some action or circumstance

                            <p>The father's explanation is underpinned by John Locke's psychology. Time can be described only figuratively, not nominally, 
                                since we cannot perceive time as such. <hi rend="italic">Nominal essence</hi>, what we name our perceptions of qualities of a sensible object, 
                                is not available for time: as Ruskin remarks of time, "he&#x02BC;s not a quality of that I&#x02BC;m sure". 
                                While Ruskin does ascribes qualities to time ("time is so quick"), as does Aliquis ("how time incessant flies"), 
                                their qualities are drawn from figural similitudes of swiftness, shortness,
                                and so on, not from observances of time as such. As Aliquis asks at the start of the second part of his ode, "Eternity who can define?"</p>
                        
                        <p>Both of Ruskin's probable sources, however, pursue a more complex tone than Ruskin's in their similitudes. In Aliquis's ode, 
                            apropos of similitudes drawn from the prophets as declared by the epigraph from Hosea 
                            (and from Job, Ecclesiastes, and Matthew in additional epigraphs for each part), the metaphorical attributes of time constitute an argument for 
                            a darker, more admonitory reflection on the coming New Year than what is suggested by Ruskin's poem. This argument is presented straightforwardly in a letter to the editor, 
                            "Reflections Suited to the Opening Year", submitted to the the same issue containing Aliquis's ode. 
                            Its tenor is typical of prose pieces submitted to January issues of the Evangelical Magazine. The "suitable question with which to commence a new period of our mortal existence" 
                            in the New Year is drawn from 2 Samuel 19:34, "How long have I to live?" (G.B., "Reflections Suited to the Opening Year", 7). 
                            In the first part of Aliquis's ode, the closing lines of each stanza steadily march toward the same bleak question: 
                            "Denote how time incessant flies"--"Prefigure the short life of man"--"Show Time's events uncertain all"--"Time's gifts but vain and false attest"--"For 
                            he shall life immortal gain, / Who lives to God, and dies in peace". In the second part, if the attributes of eternity, like those of time, cannot be perceived directly, 
                            a picture of eternal life is presented as confidently as the certitude of death. In the third part, a return to scriptural analogies builds toward a millenial promise of "Time" resulting in universal peace 
                            and a world converted to Christianity: "Here jarring sects in one great work unite, / . . . / And every kingdom shall their Saviour own, / And every language shall express his praise" 
                            (Aliquis, &#x201C;For the New Year&#x2014;1826&#x201C;, 14-15).</p>

                            <p>Ruskin's poem, "Time", differs from Aliquis's ode not only in confining his similitude to a single "figure" or emblem of Time; 
                                that figure is also circumscribed within a space that excludes reflections on death and transformation, which are encouraged 
                                by contributions to the Evangelical Magazine. 
                                In this respect, his poem is narrower compared not only to Aliquis's complex ode but even to Aikin and Barbauld's dialogue "On Emblems", 
                                which is his evident source for the visible attributes of the emblem, Time. Ruskin omits how, in the dialogue, that emblem is evolved from a traditrional emblem of Death. 
                                The girl, Cecilia, turns her Papa's attention to that figure. The emphasis of the dialogue, however, unlike the religious purpose of the magazine pieces, 
                                seems focused on distinguishing sense perception from analogical reasoning:</p>

                                            P. Certainly, or you could not know that it meant Death. How is he represented?
                                            C. He is nothing but bones, and he holds a scythe in one hand, and an hour-glass in the other.
                                            P. Well--how do you interpret these emblems?
                                            C. I suppose he is all bones, because nothing but bones are left after a dead body has lain long in the grave.
                                            P. True. This, however, is not so properly an emblem, as the real and visible effect of death.</l>

                            <p>Yet, if Aikin and Barbauld's main purpose in the dialogue is rational and philosophical, the analysis of the emblem shades into a scripture lesson on the fraility of life, 
                                which Ruskin omits from his poem. While appropriating the emblematic details from the dialogue, he divorces his figure of Time from that of Death,

                                            <l>P. But the scythe?
                                            C. Is not that because death mows down every thing?
                                            P. It is. No instrument could so properly represent the wide-wasting sway of death, which sweeps down the race of animals, like flowers falling under the hand of the mower. 
                                            It is a simile used in the Scriptures.
                                            C. The hour-glass, I suppose, is to show people their time is come.
                                            P. Right. In the hour-glass that Death holds, all the sand is run out from the upper to the lower part. 
                                            Have you never observed upon a monument an old figure, with wings, and a scythe, and with his head bald all but a single lock before?
                                            C. O yes;-—and I have been told it is <hi rend="italic">Time</hi>.
                                            P. Well--and what do you make of it? Why is he old?
                                            C. O! because time has lasted a long while.
                                            P. And why has he wings?
                                            C. Because time is swift, and fies away.
                                            P. What does his scythe mean?
                                            C. I suppose that is, because he destroys and cuts down every thing like Death.
                                            P. True. I think, however, a weapon rather slower in its operation, as a pick axe, would have been more suitable to the gradual action of time. 
                                            But what is his single lock of hair for?
                                            C. I have been thinking, and cannot make it out.
                                            P. I thought that would puzzle you. It relates to time as giving <hi rend="italic">opportunity</hi> for doing any thing. 
                                                It is to be seized as it presents itself, or it will escape, and cannot be recovered. Thus the proverb says, 
                                                “Take time by the forelock.” Well--now you understand what emblems are.</l>

                                Ruskin veers away altogether, from scripture to pagan myth, and from death to reverend age: "what is he then", the speaker asks; "oh I remember now he is a god / 
                                entitled saturn he&#x02BC;s a heathen god"--Saturn or the ancient Cronus of the Greeks, whose scythe is identified with a golden age of peaceful, agricultural arts.</p>
