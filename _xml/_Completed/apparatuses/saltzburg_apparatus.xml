                    <p>Elsewhere, <persName corresp="#DCH">Hanson</persName> has argued that <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> was misled by an assumption 
                        that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would have composed a topographical poem only about a place he had actually seen, 
                        and that therefore <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s commission for <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</title> 
                        must have been associated with his family&#x02BC;s visit to <placeName corresp="#SALZBURG">Salzburg</placeName> 
                        during their <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1835_note.php">Continental tour of <date when="1835">1835</date></ref>.  
                        This alleged timing of the commission would have been impossible, however, given that the poem must have been submitted for publication one year earlier than this journey, 
                        in order to be included in <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering . . . for MDCCCXXXV</hi></title>, 
                        released for the winter holiday season of <date notBefore="1834-11" notAfter="1835-01">1834&#x2013;35</date>

                    <p>More significantly, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s underlying assumption was faulty, as well, 
                        since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem preceded his aesthetic of &#x201C;truth to nature&#x201D; by a decade. 
                        The poem was composed in response, not to nature, but to the print culture of illustrated travel writing of the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, like many other contributors to the literary annuals, 
                        had no personal experience of the place that his persona pretended to traverse; instead, his informaton about the place was drawn from printed sources, 
                        while his creative response was primarily ekphrastic, an engagement with the engraving of the foreign scene 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HANSONRUSKIN1830S"><persName corresp="#DCH">Hanson</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HANSONRUSKIN1830S">&#x201C;Ruskin in the 1830s&#x201D;</title></ref>, 143&#x2013;47).</p>
                    <p><!-- START TAGGING -->While <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> was certainly wrong about the winter 1835 date of this commission--not only had

                        He assumes a casual happenstance, under pressure of a deadline: &#x201C;It happened that <persName corresp="#TP">Mr. Pringle</persName> had a plate of <placeName corresp="#SALZBURG">Salzburg</placeName> 
                        which he wanted to print in order to make up the volume of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> for the next Christmas&#x201D;

                        It is credible that <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s regard for the Ruskin family and his genuine appreciation of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s abilities 
                        prompted him to solicit, for the same volume of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> containing <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</title>,

                        and Collingwood's explanation does not hold up: Ruskin's assignment of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</title> was not a rush job,

                    <p>In Friendship's Offering under Pringle's editorship, the prose tales paired with landscape plates work in a description of the scene, 
                        typically at a climactic point, and the plate is tipped in close to that page in the text. For a tale of thirteenth-century Venice,

                        Consisting of a prose preface and a poem, the piece fills the page facing the engraving with an extract from a travel account,

                    <p>The pose and meditation are conventional, but the additional frame of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s shared reflections 
                        adds the theme of friendship, rendering this ekphrastic travel piece peculiarly appropriate to the literary annual. Friendship is brought forward explicitly in the conclusion of the poem, 
                        as <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> pays tribute to one &#x201C;Whom &#x02BC;tis a pride and grace to call my Friend&#x201D;. 
                        At the same time, the poet/speaker qualifies this friendship as unequal, as he subordinates himself to <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s fame. The speaker self&#x2010;consciously acknowledges 
                        that his meditation on the prospect is indebted to the scene that, as described in the journal, once &#x201C;rose . . . on <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC; classic eye&#x201D;; 
                        and he pays deference to the elder poet&#x02BC;s greater capacity to encompass such a view, for &#x201C;[h]ad <hi rend="italic">he</hi> to verse transferred it [the scene] from his mind&#x201D;, 
                        the &#x201C;touching image&#x201D; would have been &#x201C;enshrined&#x201D; and &#x201C;embalmed in words that could ne&#x201C;er die&#x201D;. 
                        Word and image may be joined equally as Sister Arts in the literary annual, but not poets. Whereas <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s poetry was destined to be &#x201C;embalmed&#x201D;,
                        &#x201C;Far other fate awaits this rustic lay, / Framed for the passing purpose of a day&#x201D;. While the scrap from <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s journal

                        nonetheless maintains the neoclassical ordering of the arts, bringing <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s own 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#PRINGLESPOLETO">&#x201C;Spoleto&#x201D;</title> comfortably down to what he considers its proper level for an ephemeral publication

                    <p>In this deferential tribute to <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> and its implication of Pringle's humble conception of the annual's place in literary and artistic culture, 
                        we perhaps can glimpse <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>'s expectations when arranging to usher his prodigy into <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>'s presence at the poet's famous 
                        <placeName corresp="#STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</placeName> residence--an event as extraordinary as awarding a (practically) unpublished fifteen-year-old a commission 
                        as prominent as the composition to accompany a featured embellishment by a highly respected engraver. No account of this episode has survived 
                        apart from <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>'s dismissive treatments of it, written decades later for "My First Editor" and Praeterita 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HANSONRUSKIN1830S"><persName corresp="#DCH">Hanson</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HANSONRUSKIN1830S"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin in the 1830s</hi></title> 000</ref>; <persName corresp="#SR">Samuel Rogers</persName>), 
                        In "My First Editor", written in memory of Pringle's successor as editor of Friendship's Offering, W. H. Harrison, 
                        Ruskin presents Pringle's demeanor as a "grave authority" in contrast to Harrison's "ready praise" and "cheerful auspices"--Pringle's mentorship admitting only 
                        "doubtfully, but with benignant sympathy, . . . the dazzling hope that one day rhymes of mine might be seen in real print, 
                        on those amiable and shining pages". The characterization of amiability and friendship is tied to the annual itself, 
                        while a hierarchical rigidity is associated with Pringle and his "cross-examination" of Ruskin in Rogers's presence, resulting in a rebuke of the boy 
                        for "not attending" to the conversation between his elders, which was over his head  (Works, 34:96-97). The characterization 
                        is consistent with the unequal friendship between poets represented in Spoleto, while overlooking the humility 
                        that actuated Pringle's estimation of himself and his publication.

                        in part because the editor was impressed by the youth&#x02BC;s ability to match words with pictures, but also because behind the scene he could dedicate the assignment as an act of friendship. 
                        Four years later, when Pringle had another plate by Purser, Saltzburg, to assign to a writer for the upcoming volume for 1835, 
                        he chose Ruskin in spite of the youth's lack of professional experience, 
                        in part because the editor was impressed by the youth's ability to match words with pictures, but also because behind the scene he could dedicate the assignment as an act of friendship. 
                        Since it was at about this time that Pringle arranged for Ruskin to be introduced to Samuel Rogers, 
                        and escorted him to Rogers's St. James Place residence 
                        (Hanson, Ruskin in the 1830s, 000; Samuel Rogers), 
                        it is more probable that Pringle would have invested the "Saltzburg" commission with greater significance than the mere happenstance that W. G. Collingwood supposes--that 
                        "[i]t happened that Mr. Pringle had a plate of Salzburg which he wanted to print in order to make up the volume of Friendship's Offering for the next Christmas" 
                        (Life and Work of John Ruskin, 1:52). Rather, in conferring such an impressive commission on a fifteen-year-old first-time contributor, 
                        Pringle would have shown his regard for the Ruskin family, and formalized his role of mentor and friend to the young poet, just as Rogers had condescended to Pringle. 
                        A tribute to an elder and greater poet occupies the entirety of Pringle's conclusion of his poem on Spoleto, framing the ekphrasis 
                        as an offering to a lasting poet from the pages of an ephemeral publication, "Framed for the passing purpose of a day" in the calendar of an annual, by a "rustic" Scots poet:</p>
                    <p>About four years later, when <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> had another plate by <persName corresp="#WPPAINTER">Purser</persName>, 
                        <title type="artwork" corresp="#PURSERSALTZBURG"><hi rend="italic">Saltzburg</hi></title>, to assign for the upcoming volume for <date when="1835">1835</date>, 
                        one can only speculate whether, in bestowing that significant opportunity on a (practically) unpublished fifteen-year old, he imagined himself replicating 
                        the patronage by the senior man of letters that. If so, did Pringle cast Ruskin as the lesser talent, or merely less experienced? 
                        The one certainty is that Pringle premised his bid for the reader's friendship on his humility. The conclusion to <title type="poem" corresp="#PRINGLESPOLETO">&#x201C;Spoleto&#x201D;</title>, 
                        consists of an offering to a lasting poet from the pages of an ephemeral publication, &#x201C;Framed for the passing purpose of a day&#x201D; in the calendar of an annual, by a &#x201C;rustic&#x201D; Scots poet:</p>

                        The passage then scans the town's major monuments, using a strategy that may have been instructive to Ruskin. As a Roman Catholic priest, 
                        Eustace dwells on the Gothic cathedral, of course admiring its beauty in contrast with lighting its lurid fascination as Ruskin does; 
                        however, the passage also presents views of the cathedral that are invisible in the plate, such as details from its interior, 
                        and the prospect looking outward from its terrace. This accidental juxtaposition of conflicting viewpoints may have given; the "barbarous antiquity" of its castle 
                        (see Eustace, A Classical Tour through Italy, 1:177-79). </p>
