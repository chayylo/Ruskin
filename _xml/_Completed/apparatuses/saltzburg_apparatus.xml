                    <p><persName corresp="#DCH">Hanson</persName> has argued that <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> was misled by an assumption 
                        that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would have composed a topographical poem only about a place he had actually seen, 
                        and that therefore <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s commission for <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</title> 
                        must have been associated with his family&#x02BC;s visit to <placeName corresp="#SALZBURG">Salzburg</placeName> 
                        during their <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1835_note.php">Continental tour of <date when="1835">1835</date></ref>.  
                        This alleged timing of the commission would have been impossible, however, given that the poem must have been submitted for publication one year earlier than this journey, 
                        in order to be included in <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering . . . for MDCCCXXXV</hi></title>, 
                        which was released in the winter holiday season of <date notBefore="1834-11" notAfter="1835-01">1834&#x2013;35</date>. 
                        Moreover, the annual&#x02BC;s editor, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="pringle_thomas_note.php"><persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName></ref>, died in <date when="1834-12">December 1834</date> 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HANSONRUSKIN1830S"><persName corresp="#DCH">Hanson</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HANSONRUSKIN1830S">&#x201C;Ruskin in the 1830s&#x201D;</title></ref>, 122).</p>
                    <p>More significantly, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s underlying assumption was faulty, as well, 
                        since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem preceded his aesthetic of &#x201C;truth to nature&#x201D; by a decade. 
                        The poem was composed in response, not to nature, but to the print culture of illustrated travel writing of the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, like many other contributors to the literary annuals, 
                        had no personal experience of the place that his persona pretended to traverse; instead, his informaton about the place was drawn from printed sources, 
                        while his creative response was primarily ekphrastic, an engagement with the engraving of the foreign scene 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HANSONRUSKIN1830S"><persName corresp="#DCH">Hanson</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HANSONRUSKIN1830S">&#x201C;Ruskin in the 1830s&#x201D;</title></ref>, 143&#x2013;47).</p>
                    <p>While <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> was certainly wrong about the <date when="1835">late 1835</date> date of this commission, his speculation about the circumstances of the assignment bear inquiry. 
                        He assumes a casual happenstance, under pressure of a deadline: &#x201C;It happened that <persName corresp="#TP">Mr. Pringle</persName> had a plate of <placeName corresp="#SALZBURG">Salzburg</placeName> 
                        which he wanted to print in order to make up the volume of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> for the next Christmas&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WGCLIFEOFJR1893"><title type="book" corresp="#WGCLIFEOFJR1893"><hi rend="italic">Life and Work of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, 1:52). 
                        It is credible that <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s regard for the Ruskin family and his genuine appreciation of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s abilities 
                        prompted him to solicit, for the same volume of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> containing <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</title>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_fo.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRFRAGMENTS">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</title></ref>,

                        <!-- START TAGGING -->It seems an extraordinary undertaking, however, to have appointed a fifteen&#x2010;year&#x2010;old first&#x2010;time contributor to compose a text so prominent, 
                        as a poem to explain one of the eleven embellishments--for many readers, the main features of an annual. Collingwood's assumption that the assignment of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</title> was a rush job 
                        is disproven by the probable April-May 1834 date of the poem's draft, as well as by the many differences between the draft and publsihed version, which indicate ample time for revision. 
                        Also, Ruskin's neophyte status made him an unusual choice, Pringle having previously appointed mainly experienced hands to supply letterpress for plates.</p>
                        <p>Pringle's commissioning of Ruskin to compose an ekphrastic verse accompaniment to Purser's engraving was, therefore, thoughtfully planned and deliberate; 
                            and the appointment of so young a contributor for such an important role was rare, and possibly unprecedented under Pringle's editorship. 
                            The editing must have entailed considerable effort, for while the presence of John James Ruskin's hand in the draft of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</title> 
                            indicates some editorial involvement by Ruskin's father, Pringle would have had much to teach about writing for an audience beyond one's family. 
                            All of this points to a considerable act of mentorship on Pringle's part, which he put forth on top of editing  
                            <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_fo.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRFRAGMENTS">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</title></ref>--a 
                            selection from an existing project, which required editorial polish, but not an entirely new composition like "Saltzburg", 
                            which occupied a prominent place in the volume. If any truth lies in Ruskin's comment on Pringle's mentorship, written decades later, 
                            the experience was more overwhelming than thrilling: "Had his grave authority been maintained over me, 
                            my literary bloom would probably have been early nipped" (Ruskin, Works, 34:97).</p></div>

                    <p><!-- START TAGGGING -->While conventional, the meditation is framed in terms of the manner of viewing the prospect that <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> has shared, 
                        as if Dorothy Wordsworth had composed a secondary "Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey, on Revisiting the Banks of the Wye"; 
                        and the poem moves on from the prospect to dwell on indebtedness and friendship, themes that define the literary annual. 
                        &#x201C;So rose the scene on <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC; classic eye&#x201D;, 
                        the final section begins, reverting to the prose preface and shared journal entry, and the section concludes with a declaration that the act of sharing testifies to one 
                        &#x201C;Whom &#x02BC;tis a pride and grace to call my Friend&#x201D;. Between these testimonials, <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> negotiates 
                        his position in this friendship, which is unequal. While his speaker has adopted <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x201C;s viewpoint, 
                        Pringle's speaker confessedly has not visited Spoleto; and viewing only its picture, this poet/speaker can produce only secondary prospect lyric, like secondary epic. 
                        Even if he did on some "reflective summer&#x02BC;s day" stretch his person before the scene, Pringle modestly denies his the capacity to measure up to it, 
                        suggesting that he lacks Rogers's "classic eye. For had Rogers made use of his journal entry, &#x201C;[h]ad <hi rend="italic">he</hi> to verse transferred it [the scene] from his mind&#x201D;,

                        however, he also maintains the neoclassical ordering of the arts, subordinating <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>

                        <p>In this deferential conception of the annual's place in literary and artistic culture, 
                            we perhaps can glimpse the Pringle's expectations when he arranged to usher his prodigy into the <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>'s august preence, 
                            at the poet's famed <placeName corresp="#STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</placeName> residence--an event as extraordinary as awarding the youth so splendid a commission 
                            in Friendship's Offering. No account of this episode is known to have survived, apart from <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>'s later, ironic treatments of it, 
                            in "My First Editor" and Praeterita 
                            (Ruskin, Works, 34:96-97; 35:00-00). 
                            In "My First Editor"--written in memory, not of Pringle, but of his successor as editor of Friendship's Offering, 
                            <!-- link to note -->W. H. Harrison, Ruskin contrasts Pringle's "grave authority" with Harrison's "ready praise" 
                            and "cheerful auspices". Ruskin does not mention his two debut poems for Friendship's Offering, characterizing Pringle's mentorship only in general terms 
                        as "doubtfully, but with benignant sympathy, admitt[ing] the dazzling hope that one day rhymes of mine might be seen in real print, 
                        on those amiable and shining pages". The characterization of amiability and friendship is tied to the annual itself, 
                        while a hierarchical rigidity is associated with Pringle and his "cross-examination" of Ruskin in Rogers's presence, resulting in a rebuke of the boy 
                        for "not attending" to the conversation between his elders, which Ruskin remembers only as carried on over his head 
                        (Works, 34:97, 96). The characterization is consistent with the unequal friendship between poets represented in Spoleto, 
                        and with Pringle's estimation of the literary annual as "amiable" but humble. Presumably, this would have been Pringle's expectation also 
                        for Ruskin's "Saltzburg".</p><!-- STOP TAGGING -->

                        as chose <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in spite of the youth&#x02BC;s lack of professional experience, 
                        in part because the editor was impressed by the youth&#x02BC;s ability to match words with pictures, but also because behind the scene he could dedicate the assignment as an act of friendship. 
                        Four years later, when Pringle had another plate by Purser, Saltzburg, to assign to a writer for the upcoming volume for 1835, 
                        he chose Ruskin in spite of the youth's lack of professional experience, 
                        in part because the editor was impressed by the youth's ability to match words with pictures, but also because behind the scene he could dedicate the assignment as an act of friendship. 
                        Since it was at about this time that Pringle arranged for Ruskin to be introduced to Samuel Rogers, 
                        and escorted him to Rogers's St. James Place residence 
                        (Hanson, Ruskin in the 1830s, 000; Samuel Rogers), 
                        it is more probable that Pringle would have invested the "Saltzburg" commission with greater significance than the mere happenstance that W. G. Collingwood supposes, that 
                        "[i]t happened that Mr. Pringle had a plate of Salzburg which he wanted to print in order to make up the volume of Friendship's Offering for the next Christmas" 
                        (Life and Work of John Ruskin, 1:52). Rather, in conferring such an impressive commission on a fifteen-year-old first-time contributor, 
                        Pringle would have shown his regard for the Ruskin family, and formalized his role of mentor and friend to the young poet, just as Rogers had condescended to Pringle. 
                        A tribute to an elder and greater poet occupies the entirety of Pringle's conclusion of his poem on Spoleto, framing the ekphrasis 
                        as an offering to a lasting poet from the pages of an ephemeral publication, "Framed for the passing purpose of a day" in the calendar of an annual, by a "rustic" Scots poet:</p>
                    <p>About four years later, when <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> had another plate by <persName corresp="#WPPAINTER">Purser</persName>,

                        one can only speculate whether, in bestowing that significant opportunity on a (practically) unpublished fifteen-year old, he imagined himself replicating 
                        the patronage by the senior man of letters that. If so, did Pringle cast Ruskin as the lesser talent, or merely less experienced? 
                        The one certainty is that Pringle premised his bid for the reader's friendship on his humility. The conclusion to <title type="poem" corresp="#PRINGLESPOLETO">&#x201C;Spoleto&#x201D;</title>, 
                        consists of an offering to a lasting poet from the pages of an ephemeral publication, &#x201C;Framed for the passing purpose of a day&#x201D; in the calendar of an annual, by a &#x201C;rustic&#x201D; Scots poet:</p>
                    
                        
                    
                    <p>Lines from Pringle's "Spoleto" are possibly echoed by Ruskin in "Saltzburg".</p>

                        The passage then scans the town's major monuments, using a strategy that may have been instructive to Ruskin. As a Roman Catholic priest, 
                        Eustace dwells on the Gothic cathedral, of course admiring its beauty in contrast with lighting its lurid fascination as Ruskin does; 
                        however, the passage also presents views of the cathedral that are invisible in the plate, such as details from its interior, 
                        and the prospect looking outward from its terrace. This accidental juxtaposition of conflicting viewpoints may have given; the "barbarous antiquity" of its castle 
                        (see Eustace, A Classical Tour through Italy, 1:177-79). </p>

                        <p>In Friendship's Offering under Pringle's editorship, the prose tales paired with landscape plates work in a description of the scene, 
                            typically at a climactic point, and the plate is tipped in close to that page in the text. The eruption that blazes in the night sky of 
                            Turner's <hi rend="italic">Vesuvius</hi> (engraved by Jeavons) illuminates the noble identity of the banditto Il Vesuviano, as he dies in the arms his estranged lady

                            To account for <!-- add bio note ref -->Samuel Prout's plate, <hi rend="italic">St. Mark's Place, Venice</hi> (engraved by E. J. Roberts [1797-1865]), 
                            Charles Macfarlane (1799-1858) is awkwardly forced to describe the monuments in Prout's modern scene that are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> present in his tale of thirteenth-century Venice: 
                            "Venice . . . was not yet the splendid city that . . . could . . . boast that accumulation of ancient and modern art, 
                            which was afterwards to attract the stranger from many a distant land"; rather, "at the epoch of our tale, Venice was about equi-distant 
                            from what she was at her humble origin,--a collection of low huts scattered on the sea-lashed sand, banks and rocks . . . 
                            --and what she became became after the sixteenth century, when the wealth of the East had been poured in her lap, 
                            and the genius of Palladio and others had filled her with beauty". The strategy resonates with Ruskin's later comparisons of past and present monuments in Stones of Venice

                            David Macbeth Moir ("Delta", 1798-1851), and even an anonymous author of a sulphurous "Neapolitan Tale" 
                            to pair with Turner's Vesuvius (engraved by Jeavons), Pringle frequently called on experienced travel writers--, 
                            , and not least himself (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="friendships_offering_note.php#SCOTTISHLANDSCAPES"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi>: Pringle&#x02BC;s Scottish Landscapes</ref>. 
                            Frequently, he matched plates with writers likely to know something about the places depicted: James Baillie Fraser (1783-1856)

                            but when writing about places he had never visited he contrived to introduce pertinent topics closer to home, as in his poem for a plate conventionally depicting a Continental garden landscape, 
                            which he makes an occasion for the cause of European political exiles ("La Fresca").
