                    <p>Composed probably between May and July 1834, in time for submission deadline in August. 
                        As discussed in Hanson, "Ruskin in the 1830s", W. H. Collingwood assumed incorrectly that Ruskin composed this poem during a visit to Salzburg in 1835.

                    <p>In <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HANSONRUSKIN1830S"><title type="essay" corresp="#HANSONRUSKIN1830S">&#x201C;Ruskin in the 1830s&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        <persName corresp="#DCH">Hanson</persName> argues that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> wrongly assumed that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                        would have composed a topographical poem only about a place he had actually seen, and that therefore <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                        must have received his commission for <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</title> from <persName corresp="#TP">Thomas Pringle</persName>, 
                        the editor of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>, while visiting <placeName corresp="#SALZBURG">Salzburg</placeName> 
                        during his family&#x02BC;s <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1835_note.php">Continental tour of <date when="1835">1835</date></ref>. 
                        Not only would this alleged timing of the commission have been impossible for a text that must have been submitted for publication one year earlier, 
                        but the underlying assumption is faulty, as well. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem should not be understood 
                        in context of his aesthetic of &#x201C;truth to nature&#x201D; a decade later; it was commissioned, rather, in context of the print culture of illustrated travel writing. 
                        Like many other contributors to the annuals, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was responding inventively to an engraving of a foreign scene, not to the experience of the place itself.</p>
                    <p>It can be added to this argument that, in assigning this commission to the young writer, <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> replicated 
                        an ekphrastic assignment he had given to himself four or five years earlier, as editor of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1830"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering . . . for <date when="1830">MDCCCXXX</date></hi></title>. 
                        That volume also featured an engraving after <persName corresp="#WPPAINTER">William Purser</persName>, the artist of <title type="artwork" corresp="#PURSERSALTZBURG"><hi rend="italic">Saltzburg</hi></title>. 
                        Entitled <title type="artwork" corresp="#PURSERSPOLETO"><hi rend="italic">Spoleto</hi></title> and engraved by <persName corresp="#TJEAVONS">Thomas Jeavons</persName> (<date notBefore="1795" notAfter="1867">1795&#x2013;1867</date>), 
                        the plate may have been the first work by <persName corresp="#WPPAINTER">Purser</persName> to appear in the annual. <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> gave himself the task of writing the accompanying text, 
                        although he had never visited the Continent, much less <placeName corresp="#SPOLETO">Spoleto</placeName>, which was not well known to English travelers. 
                        In the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, <persName corresp="#MSA">Mariana Starke</persName> devoted only a brief paragraph to the town, in the course of describing the route from <placeName corresp="#ROME">Rome</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#FLORENCE">Florence</placeName>. 
                        In the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>, <persName corresp="#WBI">William Brockedon</persName> drew more attention to the town, highlighting the picturesque views to be discovered in the approach and surrounding countryside 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#STARKETRAVELSINEUROPE1828"><persName corresp="#MSA">Starke</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#STARKETRAVELSINEUROPE1828"><hi rend="italic">Travels in Europe between the Years 1824 and 1828</hi></title> [<date when="1828">1828</date>]</ref>, 411;

                        Even <persName corresp="#WPPAINTER">Purser</persName> probably lacked first&#x2010;hand experience of the scene, having based his drawing, according to the engraving&#x02BC;s caption, on 
                        &#x201C;a sketch by <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="grindlay_r_m_note.php"><persName corresp="#RMG">Captain [Robert] Melville Grindlay</persName></ref>&#x201D;, 
                        who had connections with <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> (see 
                        <!-- CHECK-->Chatterjee, <persName corresp="#RMG">Robert Melville</persName>; and see

                    <p>In the plate, <persName corresp="#WPPAINTER">Purser</persName> renders the scene on a plan similar to the composition 
                        of <title type="artwork" corresp="#PURSERSALTZBURG"><hi rend="italic">Saltzburg</hi></title>. <placeName corresp="#SPOLETO">Spoleto</placeName> is viewed 
                        from a distant, central vantage in the countryside above the town, with the town>&#x02BC;s major monuments picked out in the middle ground. 
                        In the foreground, figures in local costume orient the spectator&#x02BC;s gaze toward the prospect. <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s accompanying text, 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#PRINGLESPOLETO">&#x201C;Spoleto&#x201D;</title>, makes no pretence of traveling farther than from the armchair. 
                        Consisting of a prose preface and a poem, the piece fills the page facing the engraving with an extract from a travel account, 
                        <title type="book" corresp="#EUSTACECLASSICALTOUR">A Classical Tour through Italy</title> (<date when="1813">1813</date>)

                        which summarizes the triumph of ancient defenders of <placeName corresp="#SPOLETO">Spoleto</placeName> against invasion by <persName corresp="#HANNIBAL">Hannibal</persName>&#x02BC;s army, 
                        and which highlights major monuments of the town today.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> swerves from this dry annotation, however, to introduce what &#x201C;will probably be esteemed by most readers 
                        [as] more interesting than pages of further details from more ordinary tourists&#x201D;&#x2014;some observations on <placeName corresp="#SPOLETO">Spoleto</placeName> 
                        from an unpublished travel journal lent by <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="rogers_samuel_note.php"><persName corresp="#SR">Samuel Rogers</persName> (<date notBefore="1763" notAfter="1855">1763&#x2013;1855</date>)</ref>. 
                        Although much briefer and less informative than the extract from <persName corresp="#JCEUSTACE">Eustace</persName>&#x02BC;s published account, 
                        <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s jottings are in keeping with the governing sentiments of the literary annuals&#x2014;friendship and memory.

                        The quotation is a curtailed and revised version of a passage that would later be included in <title type="book" corresp="#ROGERSJOURNAL">The Italian Journal of Samuel Rogers</title>:</p>

                    <p>The pose and meditation are conventional, but the additional frame of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s shared reflections 
                        adds the theme of friendship, rendering this ekphrastic travel piece peculiarly appropriate to the literary annual. Friendship is brought forward explicitly in the conclusion of the poem, 
                        as <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> pays tribute to one &#x201C;Whom &#x02BC;tis a pride and grace to call my Friend&#x201D;. 
                        At the same time, the poet/speaker qualifies this friendship as unequal, as he subordinates himself to <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s fame. The speaker self&#x2010;consciously acknowledges 
                        that his meditation on the prospect is indebted to the scene that, as described in the journal, once &#x201C;rose . . . on <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC; classic eye&#x201D;; 
                        and he pays deference to the elder poet&#x02BC;s greater capacity to encompass such a view, for &#x201C;[h]ad <hi rend="italic">he</hi> to verse transferred it [the scene] from his mind&#x201D;, 
                        the &#x201C;touching image&#x201D; would have been &#x201C;enshrined&#x201D; and &#x201C;embalmed in words that could ne&#x201C;er die&#x201D;. 
                        Word and image may be joined equally as Sister Arts in the literary annual, but not poets. Whereas <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s poetry was destined to be &#x201C;embalmed&#x201D;,
                        &#x201C;Far other fate awaits this rustic lay, / Framed for the passing purpose of a day&#x201D;. While the scrap from <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s journal 
                        carries the literary annual&#x02BC;s stock themes of memory and fellow&#x2010;feeling, <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> 
                        nonetheless maintains the neoclassical ordering of the arts, bringing <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s own 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#PRINGLESPOLETO">&#x201C;Spoleto&#x201D;</title> comfortably down to its proper level.
                         
                        it also installs the literary annual&#x201C;s version of the neoclassical ordering of the arts, restraining its ambitions to affect the reader for purposes of a passing day, 
                        not the eternity of fame. ,</p>
                    
                    <p>Four years later, when Pringle had another plate by Purser, Saltzburg, to assign to a writer for the upcoming volume for 1835, 
                        he chose Ruskin in spite of the youth's lack of professional experience, 
                        in part because the editor was impressed by the youth's ability to match words with pictures, but also because behind the scene he could dedicate the assignment as an act of friendship. 
                        Since it was at about this time that Pringle arranged for Ruskin to be introduced to Samuel Rogers, 
                        and escorted him to Rogers's St. James Place residence 
                        (Hanson, Ruskin in the 1830s, 000; Samuel Rogers), 
                        it is more probable that Pringle would have invested the "Saltzburg" commission with greater significance than the mere happenstance that W. G. Collingwood supposes--that 
                        "[i]t happened that Mr. Pringle had a plate of Salzburg which he wanted to print in order to make up the volume of Friendship's Offering for the next Christmas" 
                        (Life and Work of John Ruskin, 1:52). Rather, in conferring such an impressive commission on a fifteen-year-old first-time contributor, 
                        Pringle would have shown his regard for the Ruskin family, and formalized his role of mentor and friend to the young poet, just as Rogers had condescended to Pringle. 
                        A tribute to an elder and greater poet occupies the entirety of Pringle's conclusion of his poem on Spoleto, framing the ekphrasis 
                        as an offering to a lasting poet from the pages of an ephemeral publication, "Framed for the passing purpose of a day" in the calendar of an annual, by a "rustic" Scots poet:</p>
                    <p>About four years later, when <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> had another plate by <persName corresp="#WPPAINTER">Purser</persName>, 
                        <title type="artwork" corresp="#PURSERSALTZBURG"><hi rend="italic">Saltzburg</hi></title>, to assign for the upcoming volume for <date when="1835">1835</date>, 
                        one can only speculate whether, in bestowing that significant opportunity on a (practically) unpublished fifteen-year old, he imagined himself replicating 
                        the patronage by the senior man of letters that. If so, did Pringle cast Ruskin as the lesser talent, or merely less experienced? 
                        The one certainty is that Pringle premised his bid for the reader's friendship on his humility. The conclusion to <title type="poem" corresp="#PRINGLESPOLETO">&#x201C;Spoleto&#x201D;</title>, 
                        consists of an offering to a lasting poet from the pages of an ephemeral publication, &#x201C;Framed for the passing purpose of a day&#x201D; in the calendar of an annual, by a &#x201C;rustic&#x201D; Scots poet:</p>

                    <p>Lines from Pringle's "Spoleto" are possibly echoed by Ruskin in "Saltzburg".</p>
                        <p>The extract first highlights the town's fame for repulsing an attack by Hannibal's army, following the Cathaginian victory over Rome, a continuing source of local pride which is mentioned in all guidebooks. 
                        The passage then scans the town's major monuments, using a strategy that may have been instructive to Ruskin. As a Roman Catholic priest, 
                        Eustace dwells on the Gothic cathedral, of course admiring its beauty in contrast with lighting its lurid fascination as Ruskin does; 
                        however, the passage also presents views of the cathedral that are invisible in the plate, such as details from its interior, 
                        and the prospect looking outward from its terrace. This accidental juxtaposition of conflicting viewpoints may have given; the "barbarous antiquity" of its castle 
                        (see Eustace, A Classical Tour through Italy, 1:177-79). </p>
