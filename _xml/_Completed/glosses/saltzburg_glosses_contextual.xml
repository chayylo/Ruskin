                    (1816) by <persName corresp="#FDH">Felicia Hemans</persName>, which commemorates the return of artworks that had been removed 
                    from Italy to the Louvre in Paris by Napoleon's agents in 1797 and afterward. On terms of treaties concluded in the wake of Napoleon's defeat, 
                    artworks began to be restored to their prewar origins in 1815-16. In the passage near the start of Hemans's poem on which Ruskin appears to draw most directly, 
                    the poet has been contrasting the "immortal strains" of Italy as the "Land of departed fame" with "the strain" of the modern victors 
                    "whose warrior-might . . . prevail'd":</p>

                    <p>Drawing on Hemans's poem, Ruskin's lines retain the sinister suggestion that the statues and paintings were not just "brought" 
                        to Salzburg from Ausonia (i.e., Italy), but purloined. For another allusion to Napoleon's confiscation of artwork, see 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_pcs_corpus_cologne">Account of a Tour on the Continent: Cologne [essay]</ref>.</p>
                    
                    <p>The term <hi rend="italic">Ausonia</hi> appears only in the second, lengthier edition of Hemans's poem, 
                        published by John Murray, indicating that this was the edition owned or borrowed by the Ruskins. 
                        In the remainder of the poem, Hemans describes, in the order mentioned by Ruskin, "statues, richly wrought", and then "noble paintings". 
                        By concentrating on classical statues, she touches on repatriation to various Italian cities--the 
                        Venus de' Medici restored to Florence; 
                        one of the bronze horses from atop San Marco Cathedral returned to Venice; 
                        the Apollo Belvedere, the Belvedere Torso, and the Laoco&#x00F6;n reinstated in the Vatican 
                        (although Hemans was mistaken that the Torso had been removed). 
                        Toward the end of the poem, Hemans turns to the restoration of Italian Renaissance paintings, 
                        culminating in the return of Raphael's Transfiguration to the Vatican 
                        (see Hemans, Selected Poems, ed. Wolfson, 31-33 nn. 15, 21, 29, 31, 34, 43). 
                        Hemans's ekphrastic poem would have provided Ruskin with an early introduction to these famous works.</p>
                    
                    <p>The term <hi rend="italic">Ausonian</hi>, a Greek term poetically applied to Italy, 
                        appears also in "Spoleto", 
                        a poem by Ruskin's editor, Thomas Pringle, 
                        which like "Saltzburg" is an ekphrastic treatment of a drawing by William Purser.</p>
